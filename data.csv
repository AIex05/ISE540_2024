You can buy this variety both in the freezer selection on the left, as well as some of the scoop selections. In the freezer, there is a wide selection of their almond, sunflower, and oat milk.

However, the freezer section always look half empty and that's sort of the feeling you get being here. The staff have always been very friendly but the inside could use a bit of a face lift.

But even though the ambiance leaves a bit to be desired the ice cream fortunately does not!",4 star rating

First off each time I come here they can never make milkshakes regardless of how many people are working even when there is no line

The last time I went here a couple weeks ago the white tall worker told me he wasn't making milkshakes ""because"" and I asked if he was joking and he said no so I walked out obviously upset, my husband was so upset about how he responded to me he went inside and asked him to make a milkshake too and he said no as well and then my husband asked why no one is here why can't you make a milkshake (mind you it was also raining so they had no customers no line nothing we thought they would appreciate business) he tells my husband ""he didn't want to clean up the mess""

I reach out to the HR manager who says she was in their ""basement"" the entire time and they can't make milkshakes if one scooper is on the line which is the worst excuse ever because I've gone to the one on Jefferson st where there was one worker and someone behind me and the guy still made me a milkshake! At that two milkshakes! With no complaints you know why? Because they just use a blender to make it

THENNNN the HR manager emailed me saying that their machinery is down and tried to blame the pandemic! How ridiculous of her to make excuses after excuses as to why they cannot service their customers

18,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-and-jerry-s-san-francisco-4,"I eat ice cream most days, and I have been a Ben & Jerry's fan for a long time. My visit to this location in December, however, was the worst experience I have EVER had in any ice cream shop. I ordered the Chocolate Peanut Buttery Swirl. When I met the employee at the register, I handed him a small cone certificate I've had in my wallet for a number of years. (I have two of them from my college's admissions office -- a thank you gift for my work as a volunteer tour guide.) His first reaction was to say that it was only valid at the location printed on the certificate, but I pointed out to that it only specified that is where it was purchased -- not where it could be redeemed. He continued to make excuses as to why he couldn't accept it -- e.g. that it was old. I pointed out that dollar bills are sometimes old -- that does not mean they are worthless. He showed my certificate to his manager, who wouldn't budge, either. I left the scoop shop without my ice cream. I don't know what the Ben & Jerry's staff did with my ice cream cone, but I hope they ate it rather than throw it out.

Six weeks later, I decided to try again -- maybe it was just the particular staff that day? After donating blood just over half a mile away, I walk in and speak to a friendly employee who, recognizing what I have just done, asks if I'd like some sugar. Since I don't want to risk my order going to waste this time, I show her the certificate and ask if there will be any issue using it. She says she should check with her manager, who comes to the counter and says to me that she can't accept it but can offer me a 10% discount instead. How generous. When I ask what the problem is, all she says is that the store hasn't taken such a certificate in five years. This is the typical bureaucratic response that does not actually offer any explanation: ""We can't take accept it because we don't accept it.""

As I previously stated, my certificate does not say it is only valid at certain shops. It does not expire, and it is not a forgery. (Has this Ben & Jerry's been victimized by a forger that I haven't heard of? Has the staff been trained to assume anything a customer tries to use is a fake?)

I won't visit this one again, and I'd strongly encourage anyone reading this to spend your money elsewhere, too.",1 star rating

I love my artisanal hipster ice creams...but I wasn't expecting anything spectacular because it's just B & J.

The staff was very nice. That was nice too.

But I can't recommend anyone give away their money for subpar frozen treats. I will however recommend you go to 7-11. They have better tasting 7-11 brand ice cream. But if you insist, their Ben & Jerry's selection isn't bad either. Obviously it depends on which location you visit.",2 star rating

--

Your bones feel voluminous as if they may burst from pressure and the pain as if thousands of microscopic carnivorous rabbits eating the meat behind your eyeballs sends you into a slight shock.

You're lying face down on a bustling sidewalk and vomit out a foamy broth. You see the metallic pellet that is your temporal transponder puked out in the muck and instinctually pop it back in your mouth and hard swallow.

Time jumps are never fun.

You stand up, bit disoriented still, wipe your mouth, and look around. The rivers of people passing by don't give you a second look.

In your world, Ukrainian militarized dolphins that came through The Chasm and partied on spring break and enslaved the vast majority of humankind through advanced interstellar-technology and military strategy, have taken over the world.

https://bit.ly/2rJgGQT

You've time jumped to the not so distant past to convince Jeremy Wade, master fisherman and star of Animal Planet's acclaimed show, River Monsters, to help you catch and kill Rick the Dolphin, who will eventually become the dolphin's Supreme Leader.

You take a quick look around and see people everywhere. People. Just living their lives and all walking down the street.

You know you are on a tight timeframe but you see a Ben, Jerry, and Frank's and you can't remember the last time you had ice cream or if you'll ever have the chance to delight in some again. A quick stop won't hurt you think.

You walk into the Ben, Jerry, and Frank's and look at the flavors.

'Porpoise-fully Chocolate'
'Dare to Dolphin-ish the Pint Vanilla'
'Rotten Sex Moose'

Looking at the names of the flavors raises the alarm hairs on the back of your neck. Something is off. What's wrong with this Ben, Jerry and Frank's.

Then it hits you.

""Who the #$%& is Frank?"" you think. ""There's not supposed to be a Frank. THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A FRANK!""

That's when you notice the shock collars around the necks of the visibly malnourished teenagers behind the counter. And the people walking down the street being poked with electric prods by the dolphins behind them.

It's been theorized that opening a time portal could also slit an entry into a parallel universe and you just became firsthand witness to that truth.

If this is no longer your world then do you still have your mission?

You slice the heads off the teenagers with your SpecterBlade to put them out of their misery and go behind the counter and eat handful scoops of 'Porpoise-fully Chocolate.'

The nano-tech combat suit you forgot you were wearing sparks back to life. They don't do well with time jumps.

The wetware port on the base of your skull warms slowly and your consciousness expands to become one with the suit.

You look at the Ben, Jerry and Frank's logo painted on the back wall - Frank the Dolphin with a smug grin holding the decapitated heads of Ben and Jerry - and decided dimension be damned. You're gonna bring the pain.

""God and the Devil may both reside in my soul,"" you say to yourself. ""One lives an apathetic life of leisure in paradise. The other exists in abject horror to make sure someone pays for the wrong they've done.""

Take another handful of 'Porpoise-fully Chocolate.'

[W] This is one of the few Ben and Jerrys left in San Francisco. I swear we are getting taken over by all these Frozen Yogurt aka ""Froyo"" spots in the city. What ever happened to just good old ice cream anymore? I remember when they use to have a large location near my grandparents house in the North Beach district and they would hold a one day only all you can eat ice cream once a year. My childhood memories were eating roughly around 22 cones in one day.....NO LIE!! Anyways today we came here because Mona had a coupon that she wanted to redeem. We ended up getting 4 pints of ice cream plus a smoothie and a orange gatorade haha. Yea yea, I got a gatorade so what?? Stop the HATERADE oHHhhH........(yes very tacky). Anyways this place is usually pretty busy since it's in the heart of the Haight/Ashbury neighborhood.

I feel kind of bad and at the same time not too bad neither because while we were waiting in line, there was a girl in front of us that was totally skipped. I guess the guy behind the counter thought she had already ordered and I though so too until she said ""he just skipped me."" Well lady, don't tell me, tell him!! Haha. Too bad so sad, should've spoke up so they could hear you! I just felt bad because she just walked her little self to the back of the line so they could see her. If that was me, I would've just caught one of the guys attention. I mean, I was holding 4 friggin pints of ice cream [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VAyb61CscwPslmFYZvR7Sg?select=9PiV0vkHk-xLlMaOD8IlYQ] and wanting to order more. Who do they really want to service first? Haha....... man i'm going straight to hell lol.

Anyways, today we got the ""Imagine Whirled Peace"", ""Milk and Cookies"", ""Mint Chocolate Cookie"" and ""Magic Brownies""...can you say ew? lol. Well we just took everything home before it all melted. I really enjoyed the Milk and Cookies ice cream. It had a healthy serving of cookies in there. The flavor was sweet and yummy. It was also the same for the Mint Chocolate Cookie as well but I think I preferred the Milk and Cookies better. I tried a little bit of the Magic Brownies that gave me Magic Brownies in the bathroom lol i'm jk. It was basically blackberries with sweet cream ice cream and brownies. The flavors in my opinion didn't fit my palate so i'll leave that for Mona to finish. We have yet to open up the Imagine Whirled Peace but Mona tells me that it's her favorite so maybe we'll review that later on.

Overall parking here is horrible and luckily again I had the Miata and was lucky enough to just circle the block once until I spotted a guy coming out of his parking spot and I quickly jumped on it. It's great to come here and get a nice little cone on a hot day to refresh yourself and enjoy all the little independent shops here.

Only downside is there isn't anywhere to sit, but a good window view to stand and enjoy your ice cream.",4 star rating

The ice cream here is pretty tasty, but can get very pricey, especially if you order items like milkshakes and sundaes. I like that they have a large variety of waffle cones and bowls for sale, and that they allow you to mix as many flavors into your milkshake as you would like. The workers here are very friendly and are always more than patient when waiting for customers to order or when sampling out flavors.",4 star rating

I've always loved Ben & Jerry's ice cream. It's very delicious and I buy pints for myself whenever I feel like I deserve it. This is a nice little shop, but it is admittedly over priced per serving which is why I avoid going there.

The times I do go there, I try to get the flavors that are not sold in stores or are 'test batches.' I glanced around and I saw the Schweddy Balls flavor and it killed me so I HAD to get it. Whoever doesn't get that reference needs to watch SNL more.

Anyway, the flavor of the ice cream itself seemed promising. Vanilla ice cream with rum flavor and rum balls/malt balls tossed inside. Actual ice cream tasted good but rum balls were mushy/interesting but not my thing. I liked the malt balls though.

I got the small size which is $4.75.

Worth going to if you only get the shop only flavors!",4 star rating

I ordered a cake for a company party on Wednesday I was told the cake would be ready to pick up by 10:00 am Friday. When I arrived to pick up the cake I was told my cake wasn't going to be ready until 11:00am, which wasn't going to work because the party started at 11:00. Anyway I talked to the lady who was making the cake and she kept telling me my pick up time was at 11:00 and the cake wasn't ready yet. I told her I wouldn't agree to that time because the party starts at 11:00 but whatever, she told me she could finish the cake in 15 minutes. The cake I received was the most hideous thing I ever laid eyes on! I'm so disappointed in Ben and Jerry's and if it wasn't a cake for my company I would have refused to accept the cake and demanded a refund!",2 star rating

We came in here to try it. Good thing they offer small samples prior to ordering a full cup. That sweddy balls flavor was ok. If you are into rum then maybe its for you. I did samples of other flavors and ended up with the Late Night Snack. This flavor has potato chips in it. It was on hit. Thanks friendly associate. But for $4.75 a small scoop i only can come here when I have extra dollars in my pocket. The 1 pint in the freezer is only a $1.25 more with almost quadruple size the amount of ice cream. Ben and Jerry's ice cream is more packed in filling than the small mom and pop brands[Joe's and mitchells] that sell a single scoop for about $3. You wont find the traditional, plain flavors out here. Pretty similar to a coldstone creamery but these are all premixed in the bucket.",4 star rating

Well, if it's Chandra D aka me, then the answer is 25 minutes and $9.75.

SAY WHAT! Yeah, ya'll....ridiculous, but I REALLY had a craving for some ice cream. I was stomping around the Haight visiting my favorite thrift/vintage stores and had a hankering for some ice cream, so I stepped in to Ben and Jerry's.

The two employees were nice, but so doggone slow! I get it! You like to chat with your customers, but c'mon! When the line is out the door now is NOT the time to discuss how you're from Boston, and you hate the Yankees, and you'd rather see the Yankees lose more than you want the Sox to win, and you're sorry you missed out on scoring tickets to The Outside Lands festival. Good lord, man!

I was also a little grossed out by the frozen fruits they had. They looked like they had freezer burn and some of the raspberries looked like poop. Yuck.

Anyway, the ice cream was okay, but way too expensive!",3 star rating
