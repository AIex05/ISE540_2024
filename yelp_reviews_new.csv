The beef was definitely better than the chicken, chicken reminds me a bit of pollo loco chicken. Prices were a bit higher than usual for tacos, but the drinks were actually pretty good here. The micheladas were really flavorful and reasonably priced. (Thursdays they have a michelada special $7.50 I think) service was excellent no complain, the server constantly kept checking in on us even when the restaurant started to get busy.",3 star rating

So shocked to know that my car wasn't where it was supposed to be at . Walked back into the restaurant and asked who takes care of the valet parking acted like they didn't know what I was talking about eventually I
Got the security to help me out and said yes your keys are in a bucked inside our cashier station -why didn't I get told that at the first time paid 40 dollars to them and had me wondering where was my car all this time .

Came here by recommendation, Sunday evening. After security checked us; we were told to stand outside the entrance door for a server to greet and seat my partner and I. Waited 10min, not once were we greeted. No one looked over and said welcome, not a give a minute we're short staffed or busy. (Side note, they weren't busy. With 3 tables in view open for seating)

After the wait; server was great. Welcoming, walked us to our table, and explained how to order. Checked in once after our order was out.

I ordered a simple draft beer, Pacifico, no way they can mess up a pour. However; their Bandera Flight; absolutely trash. Cheapest tequila for the shots. It was $16; guess I expected more of a dulce shot, not crappy tequila.

For those that are familiar with this area, this is a Mexican 901 bar. It was truly my fault expecting more.",3 star rating

However, it's disappointing that they don't offer gluten-free options, which could easily cater to those with allergies. A few more mainstream choices would also be appreciated.

What I WASNT expecting was how friggin delicious the burrito would be. Granted, I was buzzed and starving, but this super Americanized chicken burrito was absolutely rad. Very little rice, minced little crunchy bits of chicken, and like 80% refried beans combined with silky queso. It was like the most elevated version of a Taco Bell burrito ever. I'm not describing some sort of authentic, gourmet burrito here, this thing is a trashy food-tube that spanked. I'm craving it as I'm writing this. Only God can judge me.

Don't order any cocktails - they appear to only have a beer and wine license, so it's a lot of cash for a wimpy drink. Bathrooms are disgusting. I'm still giving it four stars.",4 star rating

The only thing I can say I disliked was the yellow cheese on the carne asada fries. I couldn't tell if it was nacho cheese or American cheese. I prefer to keep my Mexican food as authentic as possible.

The service was very good but everything took a long time! They only had one bar tender but maybe it's because I went in the afternoon? Despite how delicious the fries look, they were actually pretty mid. The Al Pastor was not seasoned well and I was disappointed. I didn't finish the whole thing.

Bit disappointing. We ended up order a few drinks and the nachos with carne asada. The nachos were $26 and definitely not worth it. They were bland and didn't have a decent portion of meat. Large plate but filled mostly with chips and cheese to stuff you. Wouldn't recommend. The beer was well poured and chilled. Miche was decent. The waiter and bus girl were probably what saved this visit. Both were extremely friendly and attentive. Vibe is solid, mostly full of customers coming in to watch the games. Solid bar atmosphere. There's no parking lot so make sure get there early for street parking. Otherwise Uber cause you'll have a hard time finding a spot due to its closeness to USC & BMO stadium.",3 star rating
17,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-chuperia-los-angeles-15?osq=Restaurants,"We came to this establishment on Friday, Nov. 11 before 4p. A friend of ours recommended this place to meet before the USC v Colorado game.

The place is very relax and chill. Huge space divided into two sections. It was still quite empty at the time. First thing I noticed was that there was only 1 server working the floor. It her 10 minutes before she got around to our table.

Awesome Micheladas and the Carne Asada Nachos is delicious. It's a great for sharing.

As the crowd got bigger, the service level started to deteriorate. At one point, she was apologetic for taking too long to get our second order of Chuper Nachos. I don't understand how owners/managers they set their staff in that position. If you are understaffed, why don't they just close the other section? They got additional by then but still not enough to maintain a high service level considering all tables were full with at least 4 -5 at each table. Our table was very patient and understanding. As a matter of fact, we felt bad for the staff. The management set them up for failure.

First of all, Stephanie our hostess/server/bartender was AMAZING, even tho she was set up to fail by management.
Maybe this was an anomaly, but it shouldn't have ever happened.
1 person having to sit customers, take their order and make their drinks is insane.
There was about 5 tables taken and a party of 30 coming (that they knew about) for 1 waitress. At the same time still having to help new patrons walking through the door, hold up, people weren't allowed to walk in. They were making people wait outside for Stephanie to go get them. I saw people waiting 15-20 minutes outside to get in and expectedly saw some leave.
For this to happen on a Sunday afternoon, with a reservation of 30 and a Mexico soccer game, WOW.
I'm sure nothing will come from this review.
What I hope is that management thanks Stephanie for working her ass off and simply that they do better.",1 star rating

31,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-chuperia-los-angeles-15?osq=Restaurants,"Pretty bare bone's operation here as it kind of looks like a half built bar on the inside lol. After the LAFC they got swamped with traffic and looked like only two servers for 12 tables. The servers worked their asses off and my group tipped them generously. It just seems like a crappy situation as not enough staff to handle these many customers after a game.

The Miche was so flavorful and well seasoned! Shrimp were perfect. I give only 4 stars because management should start hiring more people to handle crowds rather than ride a few servers into the ground.",4 star rating

Parking- Plenty of street parking. Usually stop by around 7 pm.

Reservations/Waitlist- We have always been sat right away without any reservation. If you go to see a game or fight make sure to get seats ahead of time.

Drinks/Food- GET THE MANGO MARGARITA IMMEDIATELY!!!!! These are so BOMB.

Service- We have been seated with Itzel multiple times and she is great! Our drinks and food come out right away, and even though she's always busy she always finds the time to check on us and make sure we are good!

First off they make people wait outside for whatever reason. The place was empty and I waited 15 mins to get inside. Second the food isn't fresh, I ordered the milanesa torta and the milanesa was rock hard and obviously cooked several days ago. Their micheladas aren't that great either.

The bar's casual vibe was perfect for chatting while grabbing a drink and some botana. As a person on the shorter side of the height spectrum, the tall bar stools with no back rest made it a little uncomfortable to sit for a couple of hours. But, the DJ's jams were well worth it!

As far as food goes, I tried the the Chuper Fries which were good. I appreciated that the ingredients were spread across the plate rather than piled high and that (at $24) the portion was big enough for two people (and would have probably satisfied 3).

The drinks were delicious for someone with a sweet tooth like myself. The Chuper Agua de Jamaica was perfect for a more subtle taste of alcohol, while the Chuper Mule and the Mango Margarita had an extra kick.",4 star rating

Now let's talk about the Chelada, that was a snack on its own! Two hefty shrimp and packed to the rim. I can imagine this place getting crazy busy. At the front when you walk in I see the SoBe ropes where a promoter would do their thing while an obvious area for special parties or bottle service, and like the TARDIS this place is larger on the inside then it looks from the outside.

We stayed for two back to back games so we where there for about 5.5 hours during & that time we ordered the cheeseburger, torta chilanga for the first round (lunch). Then for dinner we had the carne asada sopes and tacos and let me tell you everything we ordered was delicious. Drinks were a 10/10 as well.

Not knowing when we arrived, Mexico was going to play against Canada... and of course, Mexico won, making it a good ending to our night.

66,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-chuperia-los-angeles-15?osq=Restaurants,"Update:

After we finally sat down and got a table unfortunately the service wasn't the greatest, they were so packed and under staffed that it took a bar tender to take our order and to top it off we weren't even attended too as much as everyone else. I understand every industry is struggling and recovering but if that is the case then don't over pack your facility and have a time limit on each table.

When finally did get to place our order two of my sisters drinks literally didn't come out until almost right before the food came to our table which was literally 1 hour and then my order didn't even come out with everyone else's and the fact that they were shareable items I basically requested to cancel my nachos cause all of my sisters fed me food from their plate.

Then when it was time to pay I noticed a discrepancy in our bill and I literally had to argue with our bar tender/server to take the item off as we didn't order it and it was brought to our table by another server as a complementary dish.

Overall, until the owner gets things under control I wouldn't never come back to this location, there are other locations I'm will to try as the food and drinks weren't that bad to drink and eat again, just this location was horrible! But I guess that is what happens when the owner is young and wants to be part of the cool kids club!",1 star rating

Drinks: The Chuper mango cart michelada was pretty good, except they use frozen mango chunks instead of real mango and they were large pieces so wasn't the greatest. The chupaloma was very bitter but not horrible.
Food: I got the carne asada tostadas and the tostadas were very stale. I asked the server if I could just get tortillas instead and she did it with no problem, and took the tostadas off from our tab. I told her it wasn't a problem and the food was still good but she insisted.

Pricing 3/5
Service 1/5
Food 2/5

Some of the positives are the chamoy is really good although not everyone likes it on their drinks. The pineapple water was really good but was mostly ice and for 12 dollars I would never pay for that again. The fish tacos and the shrimp tacos were both average to below average in taste and the sauce they used didn't really add much flavor. The pictures I added shows the non alcoholic pineapple water (tall cup) and alcoholic pineapple (short cup).

The service was so awful I'll summarize it just by saying I had to wait 25 minutes for a canned coke.

Overall this place seemed to once be good because it has great reviews but at its current state I would not return anytime soon.",2 star rating

The tacos were so delicious, the meat was cooked to perfection, seasoned to right amount of saltiness, and the tortillas were very fresh.
For my main meal I got the chorizo with beans and flour tortillas. It was very easy to eat and satisfied my hunger.
We went in the morning as soon as they opened and there were quite a bit of people coming in. They also had music playing and it was very lively.

ONLY thing I'd recommend/suggest would be that the tables have hooks under them to hang purses/sweaters & that the restaurant has more tequila options.

Having been to the Mission St location a couple of times, the first thing on my mind while driving by and noticing the sign was did I just see a La Chuperia sign!? I safely turned back to confirm and although we're currently on a heatwave, my eyes were not playing tricks on me. I was blessed by the parking higher powers, and found a meter a few feet away! Being dinner time, all I could think of were how good the legendary chicken nachos had been and knew I had to have some today. Lonnie was super warm and welcoming with lots of stories to share. Yasmine was exceptionally attentive, knowledgeable about all the beer selections and was able to make recommendations to pair with the chicken nachos and even offered to bring me samples to make sure I was satisfied with the recommendations. Being towards the end of the week, the ambiance was chill and unpretentious which I appreciated very much. There's a lot of televisions for all the sports fans, cool tunes, but not so loud that you have to yell across the table to be heard, cool air conditioning during a summer heatwave and the place was very clean. I actually noticed the team disinfecting the tables and stools very throughly after folks would leave. I am definitely coming back to try other food and cocktails. I tried the chuper agua de jamaica cocktail and it was perfect! When you find yourself around the area or want to try a new place with delicious food and drinks, I recommend La Chuperia.

The bouncer was a really nice dude. It took about 15 minutes to get a waiter to come and take our order, another 15 to get our drink, and another 10 for the food. the food was ok, i got the carne asada quesadilla and he got torta chilanga which we thought would be toasted but wasnt

they don't allow any modifications to their drinks or their food items (my guess is everything is pre-made) so if you have an allergy or a dietary restriction this place isn't for you

We both ordered CHUPER AGUA DE PIÑAs - suppose to be a pineapple drink and CHUPER BANDERA FLIGHT which is 3 shot tasters or so we though. The pineapple drink tasted like pineapple but the garnish for it was a dried mango like the one they use for their other drink, drinks didn't even taste like alcohol, disappointing for a $12 drink.. the ""3 shotter"" was a bloody mary tasting thing, a lemonade drink? , and a watered down shot of tequila that didn't even come with lime.
the waiter also made a mistake and charges us for someone else's tacos which was fine cus he gave us 2 shots ""on the house"" before we left.
overall kind of disappointing, because the drinks are definitely watered down.. we didn't even feel buzzed after all our drinks including the extra shot

our bill came out to $90 with tax and tip

The staff are friendly and provided insight into the menu when asked. We came on Saturday for brunch and had the chilaquiles and huevos + chorizo. Both were very tasty! The chilaquiles had the perfect crunch and the green sauce was a bit spicy (just how I like it). The huevos + chorizo came with fresh handmade tortillas, which were amazing! And of course we had to have some micheladas, these were so fun and had great presentation.

It was Friday night around 7pm! My husband and I were worried about the dress code because we were not dressed fancy. The hostess said we were fine and we snagged a high table on the sidewalk patio. The weather was perfect! The staff was friendly and all smiles. The server recommended micheladas but we are not fans (sorry!) We got a draft beer and a Paloma. Honestly I wonder what is really in the 'spirit based alcohol' which is in every cocktail. It made me a little uneasy. The cocktail came with a paper straw and I like that because I like saving the environment too. We split a quesadilla flor de calabasa and it was amazing! Colorful, nice green salsa on the side and pickled chiles so you can eat it hot or a mild to your taste! I chased the Paloma with a can of Diet Coke. For 2 bucks it was a good deal. It was so nice to see so many people coming in and the place really filled up as it started to get dark. This place is part club, part sports bar and kid free!

The music was gangsta rap which was weird at lunch time when little kids can dine....at least it wasn't that loud. Prices for lunch were fair, Most entrees are $11. Vegans should look elsewhere. The main problem with this establishment is that the service would pleasantly show up for 30 seconds, then be completely out of sight for 5-10 minutes. This is an issue if you have question, want a drink, etc. Ordering took us 10 minutes longer than it should have. The lack of having accessible service was the case for the entire lunch. Food was slow for the number of patrons. The food came, it nicely presented and happily it was all was very tasty. The asada and carnitas had a nice roasted flavor. Fish tacos were really good. Even the quesadilla was yummy and the tomatillo salsa served with everything was fresh and spicy. After eating, again, the slow service came back to bite. It took over 10 minutes to get a check and this was with only 3 tables in the pub occupied. Our waitress was friendly, no doubt, but really needs to learn how to be more available without being overbearing. The service system in place leaves the patrons waiting too long.

To top it off I split the bill with my friend and the waitress took my receipt and came back and said I didn't sign my receipt and I told her to bring my receipt back because I know I did sign it. The waitress comes back to my table and long behold my receipt was signed and then she turns to my friend and said he didn't sign his receipt all of the sudden.

Everyone has to stand in a huddle even if the security put your name on the list you can't stand to the side or wait for your name to get called he specifically told my boyfriend and i ""they won't help you unless you stand in the center"" what? do i need to make eye contact with them and wave them down too?? Just make it a habit to check to see if new guest want to be seated.. what's so hard about that. All i'm saying is take the 5 seconds to walk out and see if new guest have arrived stop making things difficult. who does it that way?

The first time i tried this place was last friday night and told the same thing waited 15-20 mins outside (could see open seating + guest walking out) and yes i was in view of the waitresses and still didn't get seated so i went somewhere else so clearly that process doesn't work, i only came back because my boyfriend had been to another location and stands by the quality of the drinks and i'm a sucker for a good drink like anyone else.

The waiter gave us free shots because we waited so long for our drinks and food.
Aguas frescas for $12 (non liquor) a little too much, sad part is I really didn't enjoy it but since I had waited about 30-45 just for my drink I didn't bother to complain.
The food wasn't good imo (I got the beef burrito)
Also my appetizer came with my food, doesn't that come first?
I tried my bfs torta it was pretty good.
The salsas were way too watered down. They didn't taste like anything or weren't spicy at all. I tried both of them.
I also tried the quacamole

Beer: their draft house beer is actually good, order that, nothing else, if you go. Service was so so so slow, the waiter apologized n mentioned that the kitchen was backed (tho the placed seemed reasonably crowded given that they were promoting the USA v MEX futbol game). So why not hire more staff?? For a sports bar, the place does not have enough tvs and the ones there are not high definition, in fact, there was a slight dent/broken in the corner of the bottom screen. They don't have a bar tender at the bar! Not even one for just miches or beer! Parking is bad too. The ambiance was upbeat but I was there for the game and this place didn't live up to it. When I mentioned my concerns via social media they denied that this would ever happen and even disregarded my concerns. This place needs new management! They don't know how to run a bar.

370,https://www.yelp.com/biz/la-chuperia-los-angeles-15?osq=Restaurants,"I was excited about finding this place out on Yelp as I was looking for a nice reasonable price for lunch while in the area. It was exciting that they have a lunch special. Got there and ordered and then being told no lunch specials on Saturdays. Nothing in the menu about the lunch special hours. I assumed it's all week and it was noon. It's just annoying when you do your due diligence to scope the place online and you get there its a different thing. Got overcharged for the Fish Taco. Not the same in the menu compared to the bill. Saw this after the fact. Scanning the menu and using your phone is not always very conducive. It would be nice to have a physical thing to hold as option or a board to read the menu. ended up ordering and not knowing how much am I going to get charged. The rice and bean is not on the menu. It would been part of the lunch special, but apparently not that day. Had to order it as sides. This kind of things just dampens the eating out experience. Also I asked what kind of fish and server don't even know what kind. Makes me wonder if it just frozen fish sticks bought in the market. Didn't know it was breaded. I asked my wife how surprised are we gonna be when the check arrives. I am a little bit concerned about how the food is served. The paper where the food sits wasn't big enough to cover the metal tray surface. It makes me wonder how clean that metal tray really is. Kind of gross me out since I am pretty sure that tray is not that clean and my food was partially touching it. I enjoyed the food enough to give it a three stars. I would have given it more. lastly the bathroom was over bleached. Appreciate the cleanliness, but a bit too much. My throat starting to seize and had to get out there right away.",3 star rating

The drinks come out and one of the drinks was incorrect. We tell the waitress as soon as she sets it down, that we wanted a mango michelada not a mango Margarita (which by the way is not made with real liquor).. easy fix you would think right? Any other restaurant will take it back to the bar, remove it from the tan and add what you wanted instead. WRONG, she goes on to say ok I'll add a Michelada to your tab as well.
We politely tell her no, we didn't order this drink (the mango margarita) you can take it back and she goes on to say she can't take it off our tab, even tho we didn't order it, nor drink it .. I've been to a million restaurants and never in my life has someone refused to not fix a mistake simple thing like this before! Crazy.

Then, after 35 minutes, I finally got three tacos with three different meats. One, brown and tasted like rubber (seriously no flavor). Two, Darker brown, might have been chicken, and tasted like rubber. Three, smaller, grey, and tasted like rubber. Maybe all their patrons are so drunk that they can't taste anything. Underseasoned would be a GIANT understatement. NO flavor. Do yourself a favor, skip the loud pseudo-dance music, the bored waitstaff, and the flavorless food, and go to a REAL taco joint...

Their decor is pretty cool and instead of tables having numbers, they have names of lotería cards which is pretty unique. It was a chilly night and they have plenty of heaters around their seating areas so you don't have to worry about being too cold but bring sweater either way. They have music playing and they also have plenty of TV screens for those that want to watch any games. I had a Paloma and my friend had a michelada. The drinks were perfect! The Paloma was a perfect ratio of grapefruit soda to tequila and garnished with a grapefruit wedge. I ordered the carne asada burrito and it was probably one of the best burritos I've had in a very long time.

Both my nachos and torta had no flavor whatsoever. The meat didn't have any seasoning and it ruined my entire meal.

And after our waitress took our order she never, NEVER came back to ask how everything was doing??? We had to call the hostess for help. I had high hopes for this place, but the reality is I'm very disappointed!!! There hostess was helpful though, but other than that don't bother wasting your time here! Perhaps a different location might be better??????!!!! Almost forgot don't order the Mule drink!!! It's horrible!

We were there to dine before seeing a movie. There were several sporting events going on and the place was packed.

We were able to place our food order fairly quick, however, it was a wait to receive our food order. They were just busy and they may have been short staffed. Our server, Lindsay, did a great job.

My partner was telling me that this nice and attentive service was not gonna last long and HE WAS RIGHT!

Have gone there again couple of weeks ago again and it was not as busy but they probably only had 3 people serving which made everything so slow.

Parking is available at the several lots near LA Live - a little on the pricier side.

I came here for lunch on a Wednesday and the restaurant only had one other party when we walked in. Though the staff was friendly and polite, they barely checked in and we had to wave them down multiple times and ask for items that were missing/requested but never brought. Not the biggest fan, considering it was basically empty.

So I'm not a smoked brisket/meat person, but I do hear it's good. We opted for other options -
- Garlic Bread Starter: Delish & on the house.
- Street Corn: Underwhelming. It was basically roasted corn with fried onions on top - but no cheese! And what is street corn without cheese?!
- Shrimp Tacos: Color and yummy. The jumbo shrimps are lovely.
- Lamb with Chimichurri sauce: LOVED these. Honestly some of the most tender shanks I've ever had to date.
- Mac & Cheese: Can't go wrong with this cheesy delight.

All in all, I enjoyed it. If you're a meat lover, I definitely recommend Craft.",4 star rating

Food was really good, and the waitstaff was very understanding and accommodating. Waiting for the food took the bulk of the time we had, but the staff you can try to bring over some complementary shots because they could recognize how long the food was taking.

My best friend and I went here after work, there was a slight wait because of the concert but nothing too crazy or unexpected.

Our server, Matt, was so great and patient with us answering questions and giving recommendations when prompted. We ended up getting the loaded brisket nachos as a starter, the short rib (2 orders) and mashed potatoes, street corn, and Mac and cheese.

THE BRISKET WAS EVERYTHING. The flavor of these nachos was unexpected, and I honestly could eat just these and these alone. Great combination of meat, cheese, onions, etc. Great portion size as well.

Now I said it at the beginning, and I'll say it again the ribs were FALL OFF THE BONE delicious. Packed with flavor and so satisfying. The sides were an excellent accompaniment.

* Drinks: they exclusively have Villain Brewing beers, and a number of cocktails for order
* Food: apparently their brisket is well known which were thick slices, although I personally had the birria tacos. They were really good with the sauce, but the portion size was a bit small (three small tacos in an order). The other orders had good portion size including the quesadilla, salad, and burrito.

We sat at one of the high top bar tables which didn't have the comfiest seats and obviously it was loud especially as it got closer to the game starting. I was so torn about which meat plate to get and ended up going for the brisket on a whim which was surprisingly AMAZING. So tender and flavorful!!! The drinks were so creative (and delicious!) that I almost wanted to stay until i had been able to try all the tequila ones! I understand it was a busy night so probably insanely hectic in the kitchen but my two critiques (I'd be giving 4.5 stars if that was an option): the fries were definitely overcooked with some too hard to bite into, and my friend said his chicken sandwich/ the Mac and cheese were both far too close to room temperature which no one wants when Mac and cheese is involved.

Food - excellent
we got the brisket and smoked short ribs. Boy they were so good. The meat is so tender it practically melts in your mouth. You could really smell and taste the oak used to smoke the meats.
The sides were decent, we had street corn, potato salad, and a bowl of mashed potatoes. I only wish there was a BBQ platter for two people.

Drinks - excellent if you like fruity drinks
- we got the Duck Around and it comes in a hilarious bath tub. Normally I don't like alcohol and this cocktail I would get again. It is a little pricey side however. And it's $10 if you want to take home a tub.

Service - chaotic but still served properly
- the staff was overwhelmed that evening but Lindsey was a MVP, she did the best she could managing her tables, took our orders, got us our waters and drinks. Eventually our food came out. She made sure to come by several times and ask us if we needed anything even though she was clearly had a lot to do already.

Well I'm impressed and that doesn't happen often. Attending a show at the Grammy Museum, and stopping in here for an early dinner. Our server, Lindsey, was very welcoming and sweet. She attended to us frequently and even brought out complementary chips and salsa. The salsa is the real deal with fresh chopped jalapeños. This is indeed a salsa with a bit of fire,
Our drinks arrived shortly thereafter and the cocktail with the basil was excellent. The passionfruit ice tea was average, tasted like a typical ice tea without any other accents.
Our main courses and salads arrived quickly after that, less than 15 minutes after ordering!
They definitely have a smooth and efficient process here,
My wife offered up a couple of her lamb chops. Here I must trot out that old cliche ""The best I've ever had""! My wife's words too, and she is very particular about her lamb chops. They were just so perfect, thick but evenly smoked and at a perfect medium, not at all overdone. Moist and tender with an exceptional crust and an amazing chimichurry resting on top. Delectable.
My brisket tostada did not disappoint. In spite of its above average size I was able to devour the entire serving, relishing the great tender brisket that was cooked just the way I like it. I found the sauce to be more sweet than I usually would give high marks for, but I kind of got into what the chef was presenting here,
Here is another positive: A "" Barbecue"" place that serves a delicious salad instead of crappy cole slaw and baked beans. Thank you Craft!
Our Lodge salad was fresh with delightful flavor bursts of pomegranate seeds.

Live location was the only location I'd been to I would not return. Unlike the Anaheim location, when we first arrived there was NO smell of anything being Smoked or Cooked in the restaurant. At the Anaheim location I can smell the wonderful Smoked Meats a block away. That leads me to believe that they do NOT SMOKE the meats on the premises and have them shipped-in from another location. We ordered 1/2 pound of Smoked Brisket and it was very Dry, Over-cooked and not that tasty. We also ordered 2 Birria Short Rib Quesadillas and had to ask twice for the Birria Dipping Sauce. The Quesadillas were tasty. The waitress was very nice. The piece of Corn Bread that accompanies the Smoked Brisket is about 2"" square and is about 3 times smaller than the same Corn Bread served at the Anaheim location. It was not served with any Butter or Honey. The Corn Bread was very dry and crumbly. At the Anaheim location the Corn Bread is very moist and flavorful, served with Butter.

Don't get me wrong the food is amazing. Aaliyah, the manager was quick to tend to my concerns. She was apologetic, but I do wish the owners would be aware of what is going on. LA Live is a high trafficked Spot, business also comes from word of mouth and reviews. I know that James did the best he could with what he had.

Also the drinks were amazing! Nice and strong.

The low rating is because the food needs serious work. I've been to the Pasadena location twice and the food was insanely good so I was excited for my family to try everything. Our brisket queso fundido was watery like soup and the brisket was shredded and doused in BBQ sauce which isn't how it normally comes. My brisket grilled cheese literally had half a slice of cheddar cheese on it and a pile of dry meat. Everyone complained because their food was dry, bland and underwhelming.

One rib was overcooked while another was undercooked. The brisket was very dependent on the sweet sauce it must have been slathered in. Salad dressings on the other hand leaned towards vinegary.
All of the flavors were very ... strong. Why? Simple ... MSG and lots of it. I haven't had so strong a reaction in years. Yikes!!!

Lindsie was our server and she was attentive, friendly and amazing. Very helpful with our menu choices. Was hoping to have their smoked Turkey but they didn't have it at this new location (only been there a month and a half).

Suggestions were the Short Rib Quesadilla to start. My wife and I were sharing everything to make it fun. Was supposed to have some ""comeback sauce"" on it but had it on the side because of my food allergies. The meat and the Oaxaca cheese melted in our mouths and no sauce was needed. Insanely scrumptious.

The Big Texan Loaded Brisket Potato was ridiculous. So much cheese and a TON of brisket. Not a lot of fat just stringy yummy goodness.

We also indulged in the Baked Potato Soup. Filled with thick and dreamy creamy potato and onion spectacularness.

Lindsie also turned us onto their garlic bread, the perfect starter to this tremendously tasty feast.

Decor is dark wood and lots of country meets Hollywood style decor. Very large and comfy booths are aplenty. Understated but friendly vibe and ambience with the good classic rock soundtrack in the background.

607,https://www.yelp.com/biz/craft-by-smoke-and-fire-la-live-los-angeles?osq=Restaurants,"We gave this place a second chance after a bad experience last month, and I'm glad we did. The food is delicious and their drink menu is great. My niece and I had two really good drinks but I don't remember what they were called. One had gin and cucumber and the other had tequila and watermelon. For food, we had the tri-tip, brisket, potato salad and street corn, and everything was really good. The tri-tip and brisket had such a great smoky flavor and the brisket was very tender. The tri-tip was also tender but it would have been easier to cut with a steak knife. All I had was a butter knife.

The problem with this place is the service. It took about 40 minutes to get our food after we placed our order. It's not like the meat is being cooked to order so I don't understand why it takes so long to get food out of the kitchen. We had a 5:15 reservation cuz the hockey game started at 7 pm and we barely made it to our seats before the game started. If service were better, I'd eat here before every game I go to but I don't want to rush through my dinner.",3 star rating

To start off, our server (who I won't name) was really friendly and nice. When things went sideways he told us we wouldn't have to pay so we left (instead of waiting for recooking because it was that bad).

My son ordered the salmon. When it came it was burnt to a crisp and unrecognizable. Oily on the bottom too. We showed it to a waitress and she said they have to cook to a certain temperature (not true of fish). Our waiter agreed it was off and sent it back to be remade.

I had the Nashville chicken sandwich. It was very thin chicken breast and overcooked and over breaded so it was inedible. By that point we gave up and luckily didn't have to fight the bill and left. Ordered pizza to our hotel room instead.

It came out cold and super dry and only had pickles and cheese on it, no sauce or anything - I mentioned to the server and he brought the SAME burger back with added peppers but was still missing the other toppings - i tried to take a bite but it was unbearably salty and dry.

Broccolini was burnt (not ""charred "") and over cooked and cold. So Gross!!!

Server tried to act like he was taking care of us by giving us free nachos - that were also very unappealing.

Fries were incredibly salty and tasted old

Also- Not sure why people are saying the prices are good- it's super overpriced low quality food. We Would never come back.",1 star rating

I'm not sure how other people have raving reviews but my experience was definitely not a good one. Came in, stood up front and were ignored. Two staff members were at the bar but completely ignored us standing there. Ordered: 1)short rib quesadilla, which is the only saving grace 2) loaded nachos, the meat was cold and some chips were stale. It wasn't very tasty, nothing special. 3) beef tri tip, again cold meat. Ate one slice and couldn't keep going. Not worth the money for sure. 4) waffle fries were good at least. This is definitely not the place for real smoked, savory bbq. My table napkin was filthy, absolutely gross. I would much rather use disposable paper napkins if you can't launder them right. We were seated in this tiny table when there were lots and I mean lots of other tables open. The restaurant is huge. When our dishes arrived, it barely fit the table and I told the server we need a bigger table but she just ignored what I said.

No, I hope your SERVICE gets better... In terms of the food, the chicken was dry, brisket was good. On top of all this, they ran my credit card TWICE for ""authorization"" because that how their payment system is set up. The only decent part of this experience was the manager/owner who took my order, but that's probably because he noticed how Joanna didn't even get to me as soon as I was sat down.

We had a 5:30 reservation before our 7:30 game and were seated upstairs immediately. Our server was very nice and professional and took our order fairly quickly although it was apparent that she had too many parties to serve. And then we waited. It took over 10 minutes for a Diet Coke and Hard Lemonade to come out and it was obvious from the very melted ice and my first sip of my flat and watery Diet Coke that it had been poured quite a while before it was served. And then we waited some more! After 40 minutes I asked another server about our order and she looked it up on her device and said ""we are running at about 35 minutes in the kitchen right now so you should be up next"". We had ordered a salad, 2 appetizers and some tacos. Another 5 minutes go by and our food begins to arrive and it is cold and the grease from the BBQ brisket has soaked into the tortillas for the quesadillas and into the fries for the brisket nachos. We did not want to chance sending the food back because by then we just wanted to eat what we could and go across the street to our game. And, not all of the food had even come out! It was another five minutes before my husbands tacos came. Cold, greasy food just doesn't taste good. And giving your servers so many tables that they can't even bring you your check when you are ready to go does not make for a good experience. We really wanted to like this restaurant but sadly, no.

I asked to speak to the manager, and a cook came out and initially responded aggressively when I inquired if he was the manager. I then requested to speak to someone in a higher position to address the issue. I spoke to Allison, who explained that a waitress had informed her that we were drunk and loud, but she personally didn't see any evidence of that. Considering that the restaurant was playing loud music, it was puzzling why we were singled out. Although Allison offered to serve us, I declined, paid, and left.

Starting with the set up, it's open, indoor outdoor seating, hipster vibe. Very clean but not sterile/unwelcoming. You place the order at the counter and find yourself a table. It feels causal but not cheap.

Food wise, there were so many dishes I wanted to try and had a hard time deciding. We ended up with 3 menu items, but I was already planning on what to get when I return. Everything we got was delicious and more authentic than expected.

Pan fried pork buns: 4/5 The bun/skin was a little thicker than I liked, but that was just a personal preference. The flavor was great and the filling was proportional.

Slack noodles: 5/5 perfection!! It was exactly how they make it in Taiwan. Simple, with amazing flavors. A very nostalgic dish for me! (Thank you Pine & Crane)

Dou hua (tofu pudding): 5/5 I was having a hard time choosing between this and the mochi, coz both were my childhood favorite desserts. The portion was pretty big, and it came with taro balls, red beans, boba balls on tofu pudding. The tofu pudding could be a little more silkier but it still hit the spot.

My friend recommended the minced pork on rice because of its simplicity and authenticity. The dish did not disappoint. I really loved the soy daikon too. Based on other reviews the beef roll was a must and it was pretty good as well.

Firstly, parking is not great but it's kinda accessible by public transportation. This location does have ample seating and great decor. Menu is a bit bigger so I wanted to try some new things. Taste, speed of service, and friendliness of staff is consistent. I think they definitely have a specific personality type they hire because everyone is unique but very sweet and welcoming.

Things I tried this time: all day breakfast sandwich, Taiwanese sticky rice, and pan fried dumplings. I also got shaken iced black tea and Hakka mochi but I've also had those at Joy before. All day sandwich is good and simple but for me I would want it to be just a little bit more salty to balance the number of bread slices. Taiwanese sticky rice had banging flavors but just a bit too soft for my preference just because I wanted it to be a little more chewy. Pan fried dumplings were delicious and so juicy, great crisp on the bottom. I would consider ordering any/all of those items again but none of them are like my number one. The Hakka mochi I got to-go, tastes delicious as I expected. Definitely want to try a soup or other menu item next.",5 star rating

I visited on a Saturday afternoon, and the line was out the door. Thankfully, the line moved quickly, and my party ordered and was seated within half an hour. I loved the cute stickers and cards that were sold at the cash register. The inside was bustling with people, but luckily there was plenty of seating. I appreciated how much outdoor seating there was. The store had beautiful decor and was filled with plants and warm lighting.

The food was delicious! We started off with the pan fried pork buns. The outside was chewy with a crispy bottom, and the filling was steaming. The wonton noodle soup had an umami broth. I appreciated the crunchy bok choy, chewy noodles, and savory shrimp wontons - another solid entree! The minced pork on rice was my absolute favorite dish. The braised minced pork had such a depth of flavor and paired so nicely with the soy braised egg. I loved the house daikon pickles, a fresh balance to the rich minced pork. I absolutely need to try more of Pine & Crane's savory offerings because the dishes I did try were incredible.

The food was so good that I proceeded to visit again a couple hours later for dessert! I got the fruit shaved ice, and it completely blew my mind. The fresh strawberries and pineapples were sweet, covered with brown sugar syrup and condensed milk. I was such a fan of the egg pudding in the middle - it was soft and decadent. I would come back solely for the dessert - the shaved ice was just that good.

- warm soup dessert

At the entrance, you place your order, get a number, then find a seat.

Pine and Crane is Taiwanese fusion style eats and their portions are big enough to share. However if you're a big eater, the portions are not too big for one person.

The food took a while to come out, but it was fresh and the servers were kind. It was a bit awkward that we had to ask for additional silverware and plates. Service was also a bit slow even with only a few occupied tables.

Now down to the food:

Beancurd noodle salad was good. It didn't have a kick despite having some chili peppers in it.

Sticky rice was not a rice wrap/ tamale. It's a bowl full of flavored sticky rice with sausage, shrimp peanuts and cilantro. The taste reminded me of the motherland. Lots of umami flavor.

Dan Dan noodle wasn't flavorful. The peanut and the sesame wasn't really strong. In addition, it could use more garlic. However, I really enjoyed the chewiness of the rice noodles.

Beef noodle soup had an umami earthy flavor. This dish was the star of the table. The beef was tender, the noodles were chewy and the broth was full of flavor.

Pan fried dumplings were ok. The skin was really thick, a bit too thick. The juice didn't have a strong flavor.

Overall, the beef noodle soup is probably the only dish we ordered worth coming back for. For the price point, it's better to drive 20 minutes to SGV if you're looking for really great food. If you're looking for ambiance and really good beef noodle soup, here's the spot.

Wowza, this place hit all the marks. The Taiwanese food was super tasty. Service was excellent. You order at the counter, get your number, and hopefully find a place to sit down. We saw folks waiting during meal times. We told them it was our first time and got a free lotus root appetizer and dessert. Here's what we ordered:

Lotus root - 5/5 - so delicious and one of my favorite things to eat.
Dan Dan Noodles- 5/5 - peanut forward noodle dish. How could you not like peanuts and springy noodles.
3 cups chicken- 4/5 - delicious umami flavor
Forbidden Rice pudding- 5/5 - they gave us strawberries as well to cut the sweetness!
Pan Fried Pork buns- 5/5- can't go wrong with this one.

Beef noodle soup: good flavor and a decent balance of meat to noodle to broth ratio. Noodles were al dente and beef was tender.

Fried mushrooms and rice cakes: definitely recommend as it's a good appetizer of crunchy and soft.

Their hot brewed tea was also very good quality and definitely authentic. You can also buy it on their shelves and other merch.

Started with the Rice Cakes & Mushrooms appetizer which are an absolute must- everything was fried perfectly and seasoned with salt, pepper, and basil. I bet if these were eaten fresh, they would have been even better.

Next, we had their Bok Choy Dumplings which were four large, pan-fried pieces of goodness that came with a fire dipping sauce. They seriously have the texture of their dumplings down perfectly.

Finally, the Dan Dan Noodles completed the meal - wheat noodles covered in a seasoned sesame based dressing with fresh cucumbers and peanuts. The dish is simple but it was one of the best DDN I've had in a while.

The Taiwanese popcorn chicken was seasoned well but didn't really stand out from Taiwanese popcorn chicken that I've had at boba shops.

I had their Crispy Rice Cakes & Mushrooms which was seasoned with salt and Thai basil giving me Taiwanese popcorn chicken taste vibes. The mushrooms and rice cakes were so nicely & lightly crisped, just packed with flavor. I'm obsessed.

I also very much enjoyed the Minced Pork on Rice with came with a soy braised egg and a few daikon pickles. Rice + Meat + Egg is my comfort food so this was right up my alley. I didn't even need to add any siracha or any extras, it was so flavorful, it needed nothing more. It was simply scrumptious as it came.

The hakka mochi came in 2 different flavors (black sesame & regular sesame), and they were the softest mochi I've had! I also loved the salt touch on the sesame, which drew out the sweet flavor in the mochi.

My friends and I split the some food, but my favorites were the pig ear salad ($10), since they were chewy yet crunchy, and the crispy rice cakes & mushrooms ($12). This dish felt like the most unique one to me because there was good umami flavor (some kind of powder??) on each of them. All of them all were lightly fried and had a nice crisp layer on the outside, without being too oily.

The panfried pork buns ($12) were good, but could've had more soup and been crispier on the bottom. The pork belly clamshell bun ($5.50) was also really good, but felt a bit pricey for what it was. The dan dan noodles ($12) were a bit too oily for me, but the flavor was decent.

The fried pork buns, hot and sour soup, sha gua mian, dan dan noodles, beef noodle soup, minced pork on rice, and sauteed greens are all great. Probably my least favorite things at Pine and Crane are the popcorn chicken (in comparison to other Taiwanese places) and the shaved ice.

We tried some of the cocktails and enjoyed those too. We tried the Eat, Drink, Man, Woman which had a strong mezcal flavor but was better balanced when drinking it with the black sesame rim. That so surprising and brilliant! We also tried the Sun Moon Lake which tasted light and refreshing.

The service is also extremely attentive and quick, which is surprising for a place where you order at the counter then get seated.

Lastly, I was looking for some new coffee beans and decided to buy some here. I just had it at home and it has a very smooth flavor. A little pricey but I'd get it again!

I ordered takeout once from their Silverlake location a while back and wasn't the biggest fan of the food to be honest. This was my first time at their newly opened DTLA restaurant and I was pretty impressed. Unlike the Silverlake restaurant, there was no line out the door and had plenty of indoor/outdoor seating. The place was still very busy for a Saturday night but just no crazy line to get in, which was nice.

As a Taiwanese-American, I literally wanted to order everything on the menu. However, we ultimately narrowed it down to the pan fried pork buns, sha gua mian, cucumber salad, and three cup chicken. This was the perfect amount of food for two. My favorites were the sha gua noodles and the three cup chicken, which had an umami-packed gravy that paired so well on top of rice. We ended the meal with the forbidden rice pudding for dessert and absolutely loved it. I was expecting a cold, ""Meet Fresh"" type of dessert but it ended up being a delightfully warm rice pudding with coconut milk and aromatic ginger syrup.

Last few notes: the wait staff is also super friendly and attentive for a restaurant where you order at the counter. And I was able to find street parking in front of Starbucks pretty easily.

I think Taiwanese food in LA at places like Pine & Crane and Din Tai Fung gets a bad rep for ""needing seasoning "" because people expect the bold, salty flavors of Chinese food whereas Taiwanese food is more mild in salt/spice. Pine & Crane does a solid job executing on authentic Taiwanese dishes in a beautifully modern space with an ambiance that doubles for a casual night out or date night.

You order from their menu and then pick a table if you're dining in. There is a range of menu items from small bites and appetizers, noodles, soup, dumplings, desserts that all look appetizing. For this first trip I split the shrimp wontons, wood ear mushroom salad, ruby black tea ( it comes in a pot and cup for two and they offer top offs of hot water if you need it to steep more tea) sha gua mian (noodles with / soy sauce, vinegar, fried shallots, chili crisp and scallions) and their wonton soup (which comes with shrimp wontons, baby bok choy and pork broth - the broth was nice and clean and the bok choy gave the dish a nice contrasting bitter and crunch, it would be tasty to add vinegar or chili sauce as well).

The woodear salad was a stand out and had such an addicting texture, I'd totally share a bowl anytime but I imagine on warmer days it is super refreshing. My personal favorite was the shrimp wonton dish that comes with a house sauce. The wontons were nice and meaty.

We were in the area to catch a show at the Belasco and the hubby noticed that this place was pretty close by. He'd heard me wax rhapsodic about my experience at the Silverlake Pine & Crane and wanted to try it. I remembered reading about this second location in the LA Times a while back so was eager to try it also! The restaurant is casual but gorgeous, with an airy, expansive dining room opening up to a patio with a view of the South Park Commons urban park next door. As with the Silverlake location, you order at the counter and they bring the food out to you, and they will help you find a seat when it gets crowded (which is often).

On our first visit we had:

Sha Gua Mian - Soy sauce based noodles, yum
Dan Dan noodles - their signature peanut sauce dish
Beancurd clamshell bun - delish
Veg potstickers - good, but pretty standard
Black milk tea with boba--only very slightly sweet, which I appreciated

They were out of the crispy rice cakes & mushrooms that night, which was a bummer, but at least they had all the other stuff.

A few weeks later we were in the area again for a DTLA staycation weekend and decided to try their breakfast. I had their sea salt cream cold brew (excellent), and we shared the savory soy milk (like a tofu soup, with crouton-like non-sweet ""doghnuts"", chili oil, and pickled vegetables--we opted out of the pork floss--different and delicious!), thousand layer pancakes (egg & veggies), and a dim sum-like crepes stuffed with cabbage, egg, and cheese. We enjoyed it so much we decided to come back for breakfast again the next day and had their daikon cakes (tender fried goodness) and egg and chive pockets (2 big stuffed pancake-like things, so yummy). I tried their hot sea salt cream coffee this time and it was also excellent.

We most recently decided to walk here for an early lunch before catching an afternoon Kings game at the crypto arena.

-Hot and sour soup 3/5. Ingredients were great, it was generous with bamboo, tofu, mushrooms. It's just that the soup itself had an odd sweetness. Adding more white pepper helped but something is off with the base.

-Shrimp wontons 5/5. Delicious and fresh with a beautifully thin skin. The sweetness of the sauce worked in this dish. Would definitely enjoy these again.

-Woodear mushrooms 5/5. Simple but good and they weren't as sweet.

-Dan-Dan noodles 3/5. Most people will probably like these but I didn't. I added a side of pork and massive amounts of chili which made them better. Dan-dan is always sweet but for me it was overwhelming in their version. Not nearly enough cucumber to add texture and by the time it got to me the noodles were extremely mushy. Wouldn't order this again. It needs more cucumber, scallions or something with texture so it doesn't taste like noodles dressed in Skippy and soy with a tease of cucumber threads. I'm still chasing the memory of some perfect Dan-dan noodles from years ago and these were very far from the mark.

Overall I probably won't order from here again or visit tbh. For me it was really 3 stars but think most people are more fond of sweetness than I am. Corn syrup isn't a substitute for depth of flavor and I got tired of every dish after eating about a quarter of the meal. It honestly tastes like they have a base sauce with soy, sugar, garlic that gets used in every dish then adjusted slightly with vinegar,ginger, peanuts or whatever.

When you arrive, you order your food at the counter. Don't worry if the line is out the door when you arrive. Just take it as a sign that yes, the food is that good. Just grab a menu and start narrowing down your choices because trust me...you're probably going to want to order one of everything and share family style. Now to pick a table...they have both indoor and outdoor seating and both are unique and you'll be surrounded by beauty.

The food comes out quickly, and it is delicious! We opted for the pan-fried pork buns, beef roll, and beef noodle soup. Our favorite was probably the buns and beef roll, but the soup was really good as well. We kept staring at all of the other dishes coming out of the kitchen, and next time I think we will try their loose-leaf tea, sea salt drip coffee, crispy rice cakes & mushrooms as well as their fruit shaved ice.

784,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pine-and-crane-dtla-los-angeles-3?osq=Restaurants,"So funny enough, after having this on my ""try next time I'm in DTLA"" list and then not going to DTLA for ages... a couple months ago, I finally crossed this place off my list, loved it, then a couple weeks later, by total coincidence, was back in DTLA, couldn't resist grabbing takeout here, since their menu is so large, and everything on it looks so good. So I've now been here twice - I have so many other restaurants in DTLA I need to try, but I *would* be tempted to come back anyway. There is still plenty I haven't tried, and again, it was all very good.

Service was also great - the first time, arriving around noon on a Saturday, there was a decent sized wait (about half an hour), but I didn't mind the way they set it up - you wait in line at the front until there's a table, order what you want at the front, then from there, it's table service (you can order more from your waiter). Once I had a table, service and speed were fantastic, despite how busy they were (busier than normal, I think - looked like there was some big convention going on nearby that had just gotten out for lunch.)

I will also mention, I love that it's tapas style, but while not *cheap*, certainly much cheaper than tapas, so you can easily out of small plates (and thus try more.) Thus, the first time I was here, I got:

One pork belly bao - very worth $5.50. Super fluffy, pretty big bao, absolutely wonderfully melty, crispy pork belly. (Usually I just say I ""would"" get it again, but in this case, it was so good that, despite going back a couple weeks later specifically to try things I *hadn't* tried before... I got another one. It's very good.)

The lotus root, cause I had no idea what it tasted like raw (I'd only seen it candied, Korean style). Verdict: by itself, it's crisp and refreshing, enjoyable, but pretty light. It is, however, particularly wonderful with a whole bunch of complimentary, delicious pepper paste added, if you like that sort of thing. (Definitely a benefit of dining-in, the table-side pepper paste I could and did add to everything.)

The ""Slack Season Noodles"" ($11), which I wasn't *as* impressed by. The noodles were great, the pork in the noodles were great, the shrimp was one very tiny shrimp. I also agree with other reviews of that dish, while the broth wasn't bad, there just wasn't enough of it for the amount of noodles.

On my way out, I also decided to get one more cold dish as a snack for later, the seaweed salad (they also decided not to charge me for it, apparently just to be nice. Not complaining!) Seaweed salad was tasty, but definitely *not* what I was expecting (seaweed salad like you get as a side with poke). The seaweed salad here reminded me more of a garlicky cold pasta salad. Tasty though.

I also tried one cocktail ($14), with a rather amusingly pretentious name, ""Walking on a Mountain Path in Spring"". Great drink, though - super refreshing, went great with everything.

Anyway, a couple weeks later, I was back in DTLA and ended up back here. I was originally planning on dining in, but ended up there later than I meant to, and wanted to make it back on the train at a reasonable time, so I ended up getting food to-go (and a cocktail while I was waiting), then eating on the way back to the train station. Cocktail I tried the second time was the ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman"", which was also great - I especially loved the very artistic sesame paste garnish. Their cocktail game, while unfortunately very LA priced, is solid for sure.

Anyway, other than the cocktail, I have now tried their earworm salad, which funny enough, has more of the crunch and umami I was looking for in the seaweed salad I thought I was getting the previous time - delicious. I also tried the Taiwanese sausage small plate, which *were* exactly what I was expecting, just really good sausages (warning, though, the fresh garlic it comes with was very fresh. It was also very strong. Was about 2 days after eating it that my wife stopped complaining about my breath, and I only ate two tiny slivers of it cause it was, indeed, very strong garlic.) And of course, the pork bao bun a second time, which was just as good as the first time.

I just wish they'd do breakfast a little later - I *really* want to try the ""thousand layer pancakes"", but they only serve it until 11 AM.",5 star rating

Sticky Taiwanese rice was a 6/10. It was meh to me. Too saucy!
Rice cakes and mushrooms 9/10!!! I LOOOVED the mushrooms in this. The flavor was so good and tasted like traditional taiwanese popcorn chicken that you get from boba shops!

Dan Dan Noodles: peanut sauce was sweet and savory with the noodles having a great texture and chew and not being overcooked.

Pork Belly Bun: the bun was pillowy and soft. the pork belly was melting in my mouth. It was moist and not dry at all and it was flavorful and fatty/

I love pig ear salad, but I like most of the pig ear salads that I've tried so I'm not sure how objective I can be about that. I read a lot about the dandan noodles but it was mediocre at best to me.

The menu piqued our interests even further. The items offered were authentic Taiwanese dishes (our group consists of all first-generation immigrants from Taiwan, and several of us had just visited Taiwan recently).
Alas, our high expectation was unmet when the food arrived. The beef noodle broth was subpar. It lacked flavor and was a bit too salty. The beef itself was too lean. The perfect beef for the traditional noodle calls for some tendon and fat, and the meat cut at Pine & Crane lacked both. The noodle consistency was average, but it was no stand-out.

My brother ordered the douhua, a traditional Taiwanese dessert. He was looking forward to try it again in the US after sampling a good variety in Taiwan recently. His anticipation was dashed when he discovered that that texture of the douhua was too firm. The topping was pretty decent though.

Service was the highlight of our experience, as it was friendly and attentive throughout. Several staff helped us, and they were all accommodating.

Parking was atrocious in the downtown neighborhood as expected, but I can't hold that against the restaurant. After circling the surrounding streets, we eventually found a metered parking spot. You just have to be patient and drive carefully and slowly.

The chive and egg pancake was a little on the thicker side but still enjoyable. The Dan Dan noodles were tasty but a little on the milder side.

Pine & Crane is focused on Taiwanese food with a variety of options and slight unique spins (so do expect some variations). They also have a variety of both teas/coffee as well as alcoholic beverages. You'll also probably notice when you enter that the front of the restaurant is basically a storefront with lots of snacks and goodies which is super cool. They do have a separate menu for brunch that changes over at 11AM as a heads-up. I've been here a few times, so will be reviewing a variety of the items!

*Minced pork with rice: I actually really like P&C's variation here. One, it's a pretty good sized dish. Love the house daikon pickles and think it's well-seasoned. I mix in the hot sauce that is at the table.

*Panfried Pork Buns: Yes - I do think there are places that do it better. But these are super solid here and tasty. Again, I use the hot sauce to help out a bit (might see a pattern here, :P)

*Dan Dan Noodle: I think it's an okay item here. Super creamy and heavy on the peanuts as a heads-up in case that's not your deal.

*Beef Noodle Soup: Also solid. I think it's a great dish to share between two people (along with one of the appetizers) as it is pretty big. Meat is super tender!

*Dou Has: A good dessert of a mix of sweet potato/taro balls, red bean, and ginger syrup. Not overly sweet. We dug it.

*Sun Moon Lake Cocktail: A refreshing whiskey cocktail (love Toki). Wasn't overly sweet and fit the mood right.

*Hot Tea: Just a note - their tea set is adorbs and has a fun colorful timer that comes along with it. They refill so be sure to take advantage of it! They also provided some simple syrup

*Passion Fruit Shandy: I thought this was ok. I preferred their cocktail but pretty refreshing - a mix of Taiwanese gold beer and passion fruit/green tea. I think a regular shandy is a bit sweeter/brighter but liked the play.

Walk-ins only and no RSVPs here (at least as of August 2023). At least on the weekends, I've noticed that the lines for lunch especially seem to get busy! You order first before picking out a table!

Service is pretty nice although they tend to get pretty busy. You'll need to at least bus silverware/water to your table (saw at least two areas where you can do this inside and outside).

Tables are available both inside and a nice patio area with a variety of seat options. I do think bigger groups may have some seating issues here as I don't usually see big tables although did see a huge work group rent out at least the big table in the back!

Love also the aesthetic. It's nice, soft wood colors that gives off a nice, cozy cafe vibe that is filled with lots of plant life outside.

Parking-wise, there is no dedicated lot, so you'll need to aim for street parking or a lot. I usually tend to find street parking a couple of blocks away.

Unfortunately, the food did not meet my expectations for authenticity and most of the things we tried felt Americanized. And just like everything else in downtown LA, the prices were steep for what we ordered.

Order at the counter and bring your order number to any table. It's very spacious inside and can fit a large amount of people. We visited during brunch time and the menu is way more limited compared to their normal menu. When ordering, the cashier wasn't properly pronouncing some of the items and that was kind of the first red flag.

Soy Milk: Can be ordered hot/cold and sweetened/unsweetened. I asked for half-sugar level and hot and it was the perfect sweetness for me. It's a little thicker than usual but not disgustingly thick. Out of everything we ordered, this was the best thing.

Fan Tuan: Comes cut into two pieces. You can also upgrade to purple rice, which is what we did. Their rice roll automatically comes with a braised egg in the middle. The rice roll wasn't bad, but it wasn't able to hold its shape. As I kept eating, it eventually just broke apart and I had to use utensils. The you tiao (Chinese doughnut) in the middle was just slightly crispy.

Pan Fried Pork Buns: Comes with 6 pieces. They did a good job of keeping the moisture in the buns and each piece had a little juice in the middle. I generally like to eat this with black vinegar but they had something that was closer to apple cider vinegar, definitely not something expected at a Taiwanese restaurant. The chili oil also doesn't really have any flavor.

Daikon Rice Cakes: Comes with 4 pieces. Soft consistency with a crispy outer layer. This was pretty solid and the dipping sauce was good.

Taiwanese Sausage w/ Garlic: Looks like it comes with two sausages but hard to tell because everything is sliced. The sliced, raw garlic is a classic side to eat with the sausages. But the sausages themselves were bland...I didn't notice any salty or sweet profiles.

It's nice enough to bring a date here, while at the same time casual enough to have a quick bite with some friends. The services was great too with waiters coming by to take done plates and they even made sure to bring out our dessert once we were finished with our mains.

The Cucumber Salad was a nice palate cleanser/vegetable dish to have on the side. Refreshing, a little spicy, great flavor. Minced Pork over Rice was excellent and so flavorful! I love the added pickled daikon which adds that fresh balance to a hearty dish. The Beef Roll was crispy and filled with a healthy portion of meat. So much goodness here. We also got the Beef Noodle Soup and although not the best I've ever had, still pretty good. It's definitely one of the cleaner/lighter broths I've had so because of that, there is a missing depth of flavor.

The Hakka Mochi is a must get for dessert and this truly brought me back to my trip to Taiwan! The Black Sesame and Peanut dusted on top with the perfect mochi chew, this is something you have to try. We also got the Traditional Shaved Ice which was refreshing and delicious too. A little too sugary for my preference but I still enjoyed it very much.

You'll know you reached Pine & Crane when you see a line right outside and people eating at the patio.

They draw a lot of people in but don't get intimidated by the long line - it moves quick. Grab a menu while you wait so you know what you want when you get seated or buy some snacks and treats to bring home.

PAN-FRIED PORK BUNS:
Taiwanese cabbage, kurobuta pork, scallions. Not the soupy kind and I wish it had more soup. Still delicious though. 4/5

BOK CHOY POTSTICKERS:
Shiitake mushrooms, bean curd, vermicelli. One side spent more time getting golden brown on the pan. Good option if you have vegetarians in the group. 4/5

PORK BELLY CLAMSHELL BUN:
Braised pork belly, cilantro, mustard greens, peanuts. Fatty pork belly in a fluffy bun. 4/5

THREE CUP JIDORI CHICKEN:
Sesame oil, soy sauce, rice wine, thai basil. Served in a clay pot, you get tender pieces of chicken swimming in thick gravy-like sauce. There's an herbaceousness to this dish. This isn't my jam 3.5/5

MOCHI:
Rolled in peanut and black sesame. Soft cube-ish mochi that's covered in peanut dust, and half covered in black sesame dust. If you want, dip your mochi in both! 5/5

They have delicious drinks. Milk tea, passionfruit tea, fresh fruit tea which you can add boba, pudding, jelly, aloe or leave it plain. I really like the iced passionfruit tea - they use real fruit. Very refreshing on a hot summer evening.

Service was fantastic. Attentive and friendly. Although there was one server that kind of just stood next to our table hovering even if we said we didn't need anything.",4 star rating

I felt like I was back on my vacation in Taiwan with how authentic and amazing the food was. Also, the space was super cute and everyone was really nice.

We started with the cucumbers and beef roll. Both were so good. Cucumbers were so crunchy and had a good amount of spice. The beef roll was filled to the brim with beef and cucumbers.

The pork over rice was so delicious. The sauce was so good and the pork was so tender. It was one of my favorite dishes I've had in a while.

Beef noodle soup! Always a staple. The broth could have been a little more rich, but overall it was amazing. Loved the bok choy and green onions.

For dessert we got the traditional shave ice and the Mochi. The shave ice was filled with all the goodies and the grass jelly was my favorite. The Mochi!! Omg I could eat it every day. The sesame and peanut were equally matched and I loved them both. I wish I could eat it all the time.

I will definitely come here every time I'm in LA.",5 star rating

I ordered the pork pan fried pork buns, wok tossed eggplant and basil, and beef roll. The pan fried pork buns were not as juicy as other ones I've tried. I was expecting a lot of hot soup to pour out as a I nibble a piece of the dumpling. The wok tossed eggplant and basil dish was a bit better. It was some good flavors, but I can tell that the eggplant was not soaked enough longer to absorb flavors. Some aspects of the eggplant was blander than other parts. The beef roll was actually the one I was most excited for because I have been craving for it. It was the worse ones I've tried because there is a high cucumber to beef ratio so it felt more like a cucumber roll than a beef roll.

The service is pretty good and the ambiance of the place is just like any DTLA establishment. I like the concept that you should order and pay first, especially when going with a large group! It saves a lot of mental math but honestly, with the food not living up to my expectations, it really made me feel disappointed.",2 star rating

first i would like to give a shoutout for june for giving us incredible service! usually at restaurants like these, the staff food run and don't really interact with you, but he checked up on us and gave us a dessert on the house because this was my friends last dinner in the US we appreciate it!!

ambiance
very cute interior, so much bigger than the silver lake location! not a lot of parking options though

food
beef noodles -- so good! i love how thick the noodles are and how rich the broth is. no complaints! i'm eating the leftovers as we speak and it's still so good 5/5

cucumber salad -- so refreshing, a nice contrast to the rest of our dishes

shaved ice -- an interesting take on shaved ice, the pudding unexpectedly compliments the ice and the fruit. the pineapple part is the best!!!! can't wait to come back to try it

mochi -- super soft and gooey, lovely texture & not too sweet at all

forbidden rice pudding -- perfect because it was cold outside, also not too sweet and the texture is delicious

Everything is relatively straightforward where you order at the counter, seat yourself, and they'll bring your food to your table.

DAN DAN NOODLES: I enjoyed this dish at their other location and it looks like it's one of the most popular dishes here too, so I decided to go with what's tried and true. Their peanut sauce is rich and creamy; give it all a good mix and enjoy!

There were some minor hiccups in service; they forgot one of my party member's order so we had to remind them, and it didn't end up coming out until the rest of us were already halfway through our meals.

Another thing to note is that the vinegar they provide is not your usual Chinese Zhenjiang vinegar. Not sure if theirs is a type of Taiwanese black vinegar, but the two are very different and theirs has a much sweeter flavor profile. Just something to keep in mind if you're like me and love to drench your dumplings, baos, and beef rolls with Zhenjiang vinegar. I'd definitely come back but would probably stay away from those items due to the type of vinegar offered.

Overall, decent Taiwanese food but like many LA restaurants, you'll be paying a very steep upcharge for the ""hipster"" vibes and ambiance. I can get much better and more reasonably priced Taiwanese food elsewhere, so this is probably somewhere I'd come to more for the convenience and location.",4 star rating

We came on a relatively quiet day, too, so food came out quickly and service was efficient. To my surprise everything here is extremely affordable, cheap, even!

Regrettably, after seeing the food other people got, we did not order any appetizers. I got the Dan Dan noodles which were only $11 and definitely worth more! The noodles were nice chewy texture, and the sauce was smooth, garlicky, slightly spicy and sweet. The peanuts added a great crunch, and the cucumbers provided refreshment and perfect combination with the peanut sauce. I would have liked some more veggies in this dish because it was overall a bit rich; I make a similar dish at home with shredded carrots and bok choy which I think would have made good additions.

My dad's wonton soup broth was clean and clear, yet quite flavorful. I enjoyed it in today's cool weather.

We finished the meal with the traditional shaved ice with grass jelly (my favorite), little taro and sweet potato rice cakes, red bean, and boba! As a self-proclaimed boba connoisseur I was actually quite impressed with the balls and I bet they have an amazing bobarista in the back! The ice itself was way too sweet for me. As for the texture, it was a bit icy (I'm not sure if Taiwanese shaved ice is supposed to be that way) and not silky soft like Korean bingsu. The portion was HUGE-- definitely could have been shared by 4-5 people.

820,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pine-and-crane-dtla-los-angeles-3?osq=Restaurants,"Overall: 3.4/5 (dine in)

Pine and Crane is not your typical restaurant set up and has a unique storefront where they have moveable glass panels that gives it an open atmosphere. When you first enter, you get a coffee shop vibe where there's cute things, snacks, and drinkware on display. Outside of this cashier counter area, Pine and Crane has regular indoor and outdoor seating. However, you have to order and pay first before you can be seated at a table. The food does come out pretty quickly, and service was good.

Lays Deep Ridge Chips ($6): They have cool Asian snacks that you might typically see but they were way overpriced. The Lays deep ridge chips are really good and better than the basic ones though.

Eat, Drink, Man, Woman ($15): This was an interesting concoction that's mezcal based mixed with oolong tea, maraschino, gave, pineapple, lemon, and raisin tree tea cordial. My husband and I didn't like this drink and the presentation is unappealing.

Walking on a Mountain Path in Spring ($14): The cocktail was very light with chrysanthemum being the main flavor profile. It also tasted refreshing thanks to the aloe. I think anyone can drink this at any time.

Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken ($13): This is an Americanized version that barely has any pepper flavor and was pretty bland to be honest. Popcorn chicken is also kinda dry and overpriced too.

Shrimp Wontons ($10): I'm sorry but the filling was not good at all. It was also lacking flavor and didn't soak up the red chili oil either. The Royal Asia shrimp wontons that you can get from Costco are way better.

Pan Fried Pork Buns ($12): They made the steam buns way too thick so you might need an extra bite to get to the meat. The filling was okay and had more flavor than the shrimp wontons but I wouldn't get it again.

Dan Dan Noodles ($11): The Dan Dan noodles were one of my favorite dishes of the night. I could be biased since I love peanut butter so the sesame-peanut sauce was divine. It looks like a lot of veggies at first but you need the refreshing cucumber to balance out the noodles' creaminess.

Beef Roll ($9): The beef roll was my other favorite entree. Tastes great and is stuffed with huge beef slices. We got two orders to share with our party of 5 which was perfect.

Hakka Mochi ($8): They were nice enough to comp the mochi for my cousin dad's birthday. It came with 2 different flavors: peanut and black sesame. The black sesame has a very subtle flavor. The peanut one tasted better.",3 star rating

The noodles were cooked to perfection and the sliced cucumbers give a refreshing addition. We couldn't stop eating the noodles and the sauce! We also tried their fried rice cake and mushrooms per recommendation from multiple people. However, not sure if it was an off day but it was really salty and made it hard to even finish the dish. Probably wouldn't get it again.

The dan dan mian has generous portions and the peanut sauce is lathered over every noodle, but my one complaint would be I wish it were spicy! The beef roll has an amazing sauce that adds the perfect flavor to the beef and cucumbers, and the pancake is crisped perfectly. As for the popcorn chicken, it's fried thoroughly, it's juicy and it comes with a ton of basil.

The beef noodle soup is solid, but if you like fat for more flavor, maybe don't order this one as their beef noodle soup doesn't have too much fat. The mapo tofu tasted a little on the more Americanized side and the portions for the mushrooms was a little off. The cucumber salad is a classic and the dressing has a nice kick to it. The peanut salad is unique and you have to order this if you want something with a good crunch. I really want to come back and try the shaved snow, I feel like everyone orders this and I'm definitely missing out.

Overall I love the concept here and the dining experience is amazing- food isn't overpriced and you are getting the real deal. Come check it out!",5 star rating

The servers are super friendly and they were very helpful in answering any of our questions.

We ended up getting their beef noodle soup, wonton soup, and beef roll, and ordered dan dan noodles to go. Everything was delicious. The highlight was definitely the dan dan noodles. The flavor is so good and if you throw some chili sauce in that thing? Chef's kiss.

I also really like the Shrimp Wontons and Pork Belly Clamshell Buns. The Minced Pork on Rice was too salty for my liking, so I wouldn't order it again.

The pan-fried pork buns (sheng jian bao) were juicy, delicious, with a totally stunning golden bottom and a sprinkling of green onions. (The sign of a good bao is you do not feel compelled to use any sauces... you could take them or leave them...today I chose to leave them.) The thousand layer pancake was totally crispy, perfect layers, held together with a generous smathering of cheese and egg... divine! Don't forget you have chili oil, vinegar, soy sauce, and chili sauce at your table!

Everyone who works at this restaurant is literally the nicest person ever. You order at the counter, take a number, grab a seat, and wait for the perfection to be delivered to you. This is the best Taiwanese street food breakfast I've had outside of Taipei. Also, the restaurant is beautiful with a wonderful outdoor area and tons of plants. There is a cute garden park right next door if you need somewhere to digest afterwards.

I ordered the beef noodle soup which is one of their recommended items, as well as their pan-fried pork bun.

The items were surprisingly reasonably priced, it was $14 for the beef noodle soup. This item came with a generous portion of beef, which is rare to get nowadays.

The only criticism I would have is that the broth tastes more salty/soy-saucy than beefy. Great beef broth should taste like it's been marinated with beef for a long time.

This second location in DTLA is gorgeous, with a spacious, open dining room filled with natural light. Place your order at the front register, and your food will be brought to your table.

I came here by myself and ordered 3 dishes, a coffee, and a Beef Roll to go for my husband. I have a large appetite, but this was way too much food for one person. Fortunately, everything made for good leftovers. I was also not expecting to leave with a bottle of wine at 9am, but the curated selection on display was too tempting. All were reasonably priced; under $50. I landed on a fantastic Chardonnay from the Central Valley.

My favorite dish overall was the Savory Soy Milk, which is vegan without the pork floss. It was ultra creamy, thick, and comforting, topped with tangy preserved vegetables, and a crisp Chinese donut. You must order this. The Sea Salt Cream Cold Brew was equally impressive, with just the right amount of acidity. The staff were really kind.

The Daikon Rice Cakes were good, but nothing special, and the Thousand Layer Pancakes lacked flavor. Both were on the oily side. My husband found his Beef Roll to be just okay. Regardless, a good experience overall. I am interested in trying their lunch menu.",4 star rating

The open atmosphere was a standout for me. The transition from the inviting interior to the open outdoor patio created a lovely Saturday setting. We opted for outdoor seating and soaked in the vibes while enjoying the music.

For my meal, I indulged in the Shrimp Wontons and Pork Belly Clamshell. The chili sauce accompanying the Shrimp Wontons was superb - I found myself yearning for more than the already delicious six. The bao bun was a delight, fluffy and light, complementing the tender pork belly exquisitely.

To wash it down, I tried the Eat. Drink. Man. Woman. cocktail. While it didn't quite meet my mezcal aficionado standards, the overall vibe compensated for it.

It's a pay first, sit & eat set up. I was so excited to try Pine & Crane, knowing it's Taiwanese cuisine. I ordered something hot, the Pan Fried Buns, something cold, the Smashed Cucumber and Shaken Green Tea with Agar Boba, and something crunchy, the Popcorn Chicken. You gotta have that trifecta of hot, crunchy, and cold, right?! Also, I was just too excited so I couldn't control myself really.

I was delighted to see and taste the wonderful flavors of Taiwanese cuisine in DTLA! Honestly, it was close in resemblance to what you can get in Taiwan. I could really tell they took the time to prepare these dishes with simple & fresh ingredients, and made it shine! My coworkers ordered other dishes from Pine & Crane's variety of menu items. There is something for everyone - from noodle soups, rice dishes, hot & cold appetizers, to their tea & beer selection. Taiwan beer I might add, too! Everyone had a great time.

Not to mention, the prices here are very reasonable, especially with the location being in DTLA. And here I thought, I could only find great & reasonably priced Tawainese cuisine in SGV. Because of this, I raved about it to everyone on our walk back to the office AND to some coworkers who couldn't make it to this lunch.

What is this black vinegar you speak if? Black vinegar has hints of licorice and malt held together by a distinct umami earthiness that permeates the whole condiment, it's transformative, providing both acidity and complexity to round out a dish.

A bit of interesting setup at restaurant. You order your food and drinks at the counter. The wait staff will bring your drinks and food to you! The restaurant has cocktails, beer and wine. And a wide selection of Taiwanese food.

As this was our first time, we order quite a selection of items. We had spicy wontons, wonton soup. Dan Dan noodles, Taiwanese fried rice, and pork buns. The food was ok to good. The food came out super quick which may speak to its quality. The food wasn't really hot, just warm. As the food came out all at once, some of the food was cold by the time we tasted it. And our noodles were all sticking together as cold. The wonton soup was bland. As for the Taiwanese fried rice: don't try it unless you had it before. It's an acquired taste.

i also regularly order the chive pockets and dan bing. the coffee is legit.

the regular menu is fab too. i crave the veggie mapo tofu and hot and sour soup. i like to order the greens which i believe are from the family farm.

So keep in mind that during peak times, you might need to opt for outdoor seating (but we found an indoor one pretty easily).

The food is reasonably priced and generally decent. We sampled a variety of dishes, including the Three Cup Chicken, Beef Rolls, and Shrimp Wontons. While these dishes were fine, they were just lackluster and we're as flavorful as we felt they could have been. But the Dan Dan Noodles were great - tasty with good noodle texture. They're fairly heavy on the cucumbers, which can be annoying because they dilute the main flavor too much. But still, definitely one of the better dishes. Another standout was the Hakka Mochi - a great choice for dessert with a perfect balance of sweet and salty.

Service here is quick and friendly, albeit somewhat minimal due to the restaurant's ordering process so not necessarily a bad thing. Parking, however, can be a bit of a hassle, since it is DTLA (even on a weeknight).

All in all, it's a fine restaurant with fair prices. Personally, I would only come back for the Dan Dan Noodles and Mochi.",3 star rating

Being an LA native, dtla parking is not something you take lightly. But even so - this place is worth it. Especially if you come with a group of friends!

The interior is a beautiful and calm japandi vibe, where it's a casual self serve style. You order up front, get a number, find a seat, self serve some fancy sparkling or still water on tap, and wait excitedly for your food to come.

We came here after roaming around LA Comic Con, and was able to find a seat and get eating relatively quickly!

Everything was so amazing, it's one of the places you can't go wrong with ordering.

We got:

1. Beef noodle soup (4/5)
2. Spicy cucumbers (5/5)
3. Beef Roll (7/5)
4. pan fried Dumplings (4/5)
5. Clay pot Taiwanese sausage and sticky rice (3/5)

My favorite is their beef roll - the perfect combination of savoriness, saltiness combined with the fresh crunch of the cucumber. Other favorites are the dan dan noodles and the pork over rice.

Ordering and finding a table is easier here since this location is larger and they seem to have more take-out orders than dine-in - order at the counter and seat yourself. It's clean and spacious inside with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.

Prices are fair to a little high (the food pictured is $20 total), but I was full and very satisfied with the amount of food. The food itself is delicious!

There was tons of natural light and a breezy patio. The staff was very prompt with helping me and friendly.

Here's what I ordered:

Pan fried pork buns: fluffy buns with a nice crispy sear, and flavorful juicy pork inside. I just wish the meat to bread ratio was a little better. 8/10

Beef rolls: the beef was tender and delicious. These were tasty overall but I wanted a bit more browning/crispness on the wrap and it needed a touch more hoisin sauce inside. 7.5/10

Wood ear mushrooms: these were unfortunately a little lacking in flavor. Needed a bit more saltiness so it tasted a bit bland. 6/10

Shrimp wontons: even though I got these to go, the wrappers still held up and the shrimp inside was still juicy and had a nice bite. The sauce was tangy and had great flavor. 8.5/10

Dan Dan noodles: these were bland and I was disappointed. I tasted the sesame but found it overall lacking in flavor. It was definitely lacking in saltiness and umami. 6/10

Overall there are some tasty items here, but some not so much. I wanted to like this place a lot more since I live so close by. It's a solid spot for the area if you order the right things, but it's just not as good as the Chinese food from the 626",4 star rating

Ordered the pan fried pork buns, minced pork and rice, wonton soup and chive egg pockets. Very, very delicious. Pan fried buns were crisped up to perfection, not soggy or overly greasy at all. Chive and egg pockets sometimes have a super hard, thick outer dough shell which ruins the taste for me. This place's pockets were thin and crisp, which I can definitely appreciate. The minced pork and rice was seasoned very well and the minced meat was very tender. The only lackluster dish was the wonton soup; the broth was flavorless aside from a lot of sodium and a faint taste of ginger. The shrimp wontons were just okay, nothing to write home about.

Ambiance wise, I love it. Service was amicable and relaxed, I also love the casual ordering system.

We came for a weekend brunch so tried a variety of items from each section. If you're Taiwanese the English translations actually make no sense but yes for the American's its plain english lol. IYKYK when you read the description and item names.

For starters we got Chive and Egg Pockets(韭菜盒子). These were super authentic and yes vegetarian! They had the perfect amount of chives with that pan fried crispy crust and don't forget to use the sambal chili!

Beef Roll: This again was very authentic in flavor and ingredients. It's not stuffed with as much 5 spice beef as other TW places like a good time deli but its a good ration.

Shrimp Wontons: This will remind you abit of the DingTaiFung wontons in the chili sauce. There is a whole shrimp in every piece with a good mala spicy chili sauce on top.

Dan Dan Noodles: Again very authentic and super chewy fresh noodles. You can taste these were fresh noodles not the dry ones. It's got the perfect balance of peanut butter sauce to sesame with the herbiness of the cilantro and crunch from the slice cucumber and peanut pieces. Yeah this one hit the spot. This one also vegan friendly.

Overall a great spot to come hangout with family and friends for a good authentic Taiwanese lunch/dinner/brunch. Yeah this place was busy all day way past lunch time too!

The semi open air plan really elevated my experience here and I am thoroughly impressed.

We started off with the smashed cucumber salad, woodear mushroom salad, pork belly bun & shrimps wontons. The pork belly bun I believe is exclusive to this location - I really enjoyed it. You can't go wrong with any of their appetizer selections but if you're a mushroom person I highly recommend the woodear salad.

Our main entrees and my go to order were the dan dan noodles and minced pork on rice which always comes in a great portion and is always consistent.

Overall, this is probably my favorite location so far given that (1) more menu options (even dessert) (2) more spacious, more attentive staff & service and (3) abundant outdoor seating to take your furry friends!

I know their wonton (noodle) soup tends to be on the blander side (I always crave it when I'm feeling not 100%) but I've recently noticed some of their other dishes have tasted a little blah.

Ordering delivery (they're on UberEats and DoorDash) has always been smooth as everything is well-packed. However, recently on a delivery order, I tried their 'chive pockets' and they were so bland/flavorless I took one bite and knew they weren't worth the calories. By far my most disappoint experience.

FOOD: Overall, I'm noticing that every dish at this restaurant is subtle in its flavor profiles. Dishes reserve the savory, the sweet, the sour, and the umami in a tastefully ephemeral and slightly under whelming experience. For those who appreciate a simple, clean taste, this is favorable.

My wife & I visited LA for the autoshow, staying at the Figueroa a few blocks away. As it was mid-afternoon, we wanted a light lunch to avoid spoiling our dinner appetite. Looking at Yelp, Pine & Crane checked the boxes of: looks tasty, prices seem reasonable, dim sum / tapas portions allowing us to try multiple dishes without stuffing ourselves.

We arrived around 2pm with no line, and walked straight up to order. Then, we realized how big the menu was, so backtracked and sat outside, looking through pics to figure out what to order. After 5 minutes, the order taker walked out asking if she can help (we told her we were good), and a little serious deliberation with my wife, we walked back in, confident about our choices. We settled on 3 items plus the fresh fruit tea.

First up, Fan Tuan (rice roll), since I hadn't had a good one in ages. Only available for breakfast. WTH! The girl suggested the Chive and Egg pockets as a substitute and we took her word. I think she took note of the sorrow on my face as she comped us two free dishes!

Fresh fruit tea - strong tea flavour, just the right amount of sweetness with generous amount of strawberries and pineapple. Loved it and would order again if in the area - a solid ""A"".

The Chive and egg pockets: good skin, slight crisp on the outside, a little chewy inside with no ""oily"" feel. A very generous amount of chives, served warm - super important! But I found it under-seasoned. I'm not sure if there were supposed to be pieces of egg (since the item was classified as in the all day ""breakfast"" section), so I expected them regardless. There were none, so it was a little bit of a let down. It tasted decently good, but didn't meet my potentially unrealistic expectations. I give it a ""B.""

The Fried peanut salad: another item that didn't come out as I expected. I didn't find pictures of this item on Yelp, so I should have read the menu description more closely. It was called a ""salad"" so I expected more veggies. Well, I was wrong. The peanuts were nicely salted with an extra crunchy texture, and came with some bits of chives & coriander. But ultimately, the bowl of peanuts, although decently tasty, didn't meet my needs resulting in my ""B-"" grade.

The Slack season noodles: the pork was a little overcooked, but it did have a nice aromatic, savoury & sweet flavour. The shrimp tasted fresh, and noodles were a nice al dente. The broth was tasty, but the bowl needed more of it! A solid ""B+.""

During our meal, the waitress brought a Woodear salad to our table. We told her we didn't order it, so she brought it back to the kitchen. A minute later, the waitress brought a beef roll to us. Again, we said we didn't order it. Confused, the waitress went to the order taker for clarification - apparently, the order taker comped us the two dishes. WOW, that's super nice! I must have looked super super sad when she told me ""no more Fan Tuan.""

Wood ear salad: I've never been a fan of wood ear mushrooms - they have no taste. But my wife liked it. If you like cold, tasteless, chewy textures, then this is for you :) No other comment on this dish.

Beef roll: of all the things we had for lunch, this was my favorite. The beef had a nice savory sweet flavour. The cucumbers provided balance, freshness, and a cool, crunchy texture. The wrap was very thin, lightly toasted and provided structure for everything. A heck of a lot better than any burrito I've tasted - a solid ""A"".

Light lunch? Yeah right. We even ended with a significant doggy bag, and for the next few hours, slothed at the hotel. 7:30pm rolled around, we figured we should something to avoid late night hanger. So, we finished the leftovers, and headed back to Pine & Crane for dessert we missed at lunch time, specifically the ""Dou Hua.""

This time, we knew exactly what we wanted; ""Dou hua"" and Fruit shaved ice. Of course, life can't be so simple. They were out of ""dou hua"", and my wife gave me the death stare. Thank goodness it wasn't my fault, and we settled on the Hakka mochi as a substitute.

The Hakka mochi was very good! The peanut mix was perfectly sweet, super fragrant, and ground to smoothness. The black sesame was also good, but wasn't as aromatic as the peanut. A really good mochi experience earning an ""A-"".

The Fruit ice was a little disappointing. The fruit was plentiful, but the shaved ice was dense and lacked flavor. I thought the sweetness was from simple syrup but apparently, they use condense milk as well, but definitely not enough. I wish they added some evaporated milk or mixed in some coconut cream to elevate the flavor but in it's current form, it was a ""C+"" dish for me.

I ordered the panfried pork buns, pork rice, and Dan Dan noodle. My favorite of all was the Dan Dan noodle. It has a nice blend of sweetness, saltines and the peanut flavor. The noodles are not too soggy and the small bits of peanuts added texture to the noodle.

My second favorite was the panfried pork buns. It has a nice crispiness at the bottom. The filling itself is juicier than the typical ones that I've tried at other places, although the seasoning was a tad saltier than my liking.

The minced pork rice was alright. There's a good amount of lean minced pork which is pretty healthy. But with the sauce, the rice and the pork, it feels quite heavy. Luckily, there's a few turnips to cut the heaviness. Compare to the legit minced pork rice that I've had in Taiwan, I probably won't order it again.

Overall, the food is good and reasonably priced. It has an open concept to it so there's flies coming around every now and then. As far as service goes, it's more like a self served restaurant.

- ambiance- very cool LA vibe with indoor-outdoor melded into a perfect balance of chill. Having said that, the seats could be a little more comfortable, but not worth a lower rating.

- food- the options included some of my favorites from Taiwan and the better Taiwanese places around Southern California. The portions were decent and the flavor was solid, although I could have gone for more flavor across the board. Tables have soy sauce, vinegar, and chili to add to the experience.

- service- you order at the entrance, then find a table. Water is self serve. The wait staff comes around frequently enough and was generally friendly.

- cleanliness- everything was clean. Tables, bathrooms, floors.",5 star rating

Came here with a couple other friends on a Saturday night around 7:30pm and there was a short line, but we didn't have to wait too long. Metered street parking. Indoor and outdoor parking available. Credit cards accepted. They do serve alcohol. It's good for small groups though they did have an indoor table that fit one larger group.

The popcorn chicken was a generous size and was very crispy. I would get that again as well as the Dan Dan noodles. I also did like the beef roll, which came cut into 4 slices. The shrimp wontons came in 5 and were decent. The Taiwanese sausage sticky rice was alright but I wouldn't get it again, nor would I get the egg and chive pockets. The dessert mochi had both peanut sprinkling as well as black sesame. I think there was too much of the dusting and not enough mochi, but I did enjoy the dessert.

922,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pine-and-crane-dtla-los-angeles-3?osq=Restaurants,"I love coming to Pine & Crane and its sister store, Joy so when I heard that Pine & Crane opened in DTLA, i was excited. Its much more convenient for me to come to DTLA than Silverlake so it was good news to me.

I came here a few times already and also ordered delivery before and its always been pleasant.

Noodles are my favorite to order from Pine & Crane. They are known for their Dan Dan Noodles and Slack Season Noodles which I also enjoy but if I had to pick one, I would definitely go with Dan Dan Noodles. For me personally, it has more flavor. Sesame peanut sauce is pefectly smothered in noodles and so creamy. Slack Season Noodles are also great and its even better if you order a side of minced pork and top it off, it gives more texture and flavor as well! Beef Noodle Soup was pretty average, not too bad.

Not truly the best dumplings to be honest. I once ordered the Panfried Pork Buns and it was hard and filling wasnt too impressive. I also tried Chive & Egg Pockets and it was too chewy and hard that it was so difficult to eat. Definitely order the Beef Roll. It is delicious! Yes, it could get hard but its packed with flavors! This is absolutely one of my favorites.

Woodear salad!! I love this mushroom and its very interesting. It has unique texture of woodear mushrooms but at the same time pretty refreshing. Its a great starter to get you going through the whole meal. Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken is also among the popular items. Its served with fried basil leaves like other tea shop popcorn chickens. Meat is juicy and tender but crispy outside. Seasoned just right and it complements really well with Taiwanese Ketchup which you have to ask for it.

You need to finish it off with Hakka Mochi. Its rolled in peanut and black sesame so its very toasty. I am not a big fan of peanuts but peanut is better than black sesame. One thing though, when I got it, mochi was not warm but cold so it wasnt as good as I had it for the first time in Joy. You can wait to finish your main meal and when youre ready for dessert, you just need to put your cute mochi sign up so that they know youre ready for it.

One last thing, their $5 pineapple cake is annoyingly good. I hate that its $5 but its soooo delicious. I can probably eat a dozen of them in one sitting if I was given the chance.",4 star rating

Overall, the store is so pretty there's an indoor outdoor aspect and the interior is so aesthetic.

Our group tried every breakfast item: Daikon Rice Cakes, Fan Tuan, Chive and Egg Pockets, Thousand Layer Pancakes, and Panfried Pork Buns. We also got the soy milk and Savory Soy Milk. Everything was made well. I thought it was interesting how the Thousand Layer Pancakes included cheese, but I liked the taste.

They don't take reservations and only seat people when the entire party is there, so we made sure to get there early. Seating seemed easy though, because it seemed like a lot of customers came to just pick up food instead of dine there.

Your order at the counter when you first enter and then seat yourself. There are two water, dish, to-go box stations and the staff are happy to help point you in the right direction.

The beef roll is super flavorful and contained more veggies than I expected, which made it feel more fresh and less dense. It's really packed though, so it becomes kinda messy when you eat it-- be careful not to spill on yourself like I almost did lol.

The passion fruit green tea was really refreshing and sweet! Not sure if they offer changes to the sweetness level, but consider asking if you normally get less sweet at boba shops. The clear boba was a substitute for aloe jellies, which tasted similar but felt a bit firmer. Not the same chewiness as regular boba, which I prefer.",5 star rating

Minced rice: better than all the ones I've tried. Not dry but tender and flavorful!

Beef roll: I think it's the onion pancake exterior that really gets me.

Dou hua: the ginger syrup is really sweet to pair with the traditional tofu. My friend who doesn't like sweets almost finished it. That's how you know it's good :)

My mom has been to the other location and loved it. Said food was authentic and delicious. We were expecting the same here. Look, it's DTLA food will be expensive, and I wasn't expecting it to be authentic either so I wasn't expecting much in the first place but I wouldn't come back.

First off, service wasn't great. You order first and pay, then sit down. That's not a problem but my mom doesn't speak good English so she asked if we could sit down first and figure out what to order since she was gonna take a while to figure out since again she doesn't speak English. We asked the guy up front twice if we could sit and look first. He repeated twice in a starky tone ""you need to order first then sit."" Fine. So we ordered than sat. It wasn't even busy when we went so idk why he was so rude.

Anyway, everyone else was nice. We ordered the Beef Roll, Pan Fried Pork Buns, Three Cup Chicken, Woodear Salad, shrimp wonton noodles, and dan dan noodles. The only thing I would recommend is the dan dan noodles. Everything else didn't really have flavor at all, let alone authenticity.

We were so impressed by the food, service, and overall experience! The restaurant was busy and there was a line to order food yet we were seated immediately! Then maybe 10 minutes later the food was already coming in hot one by one. The Shrimp Wontons in the house sauce was delicious and well cooked... I highly recommend a lil splash of vinegar and chili sauce for a little more bite! The Beef Roll was simple, savory, and refreshing... cilantro and cucumbers layered with the thinly sliced 5 spiced beef wrapped in the dough- yum! The Dan Dan Noodles were chewy, creamy, sweet, and nutty. The thinly sliced cucumbers are the perfect refreshing topper/garnish to the dish. The Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken, just wow, the best popcorn chicken I've ever had?! It's tender, perfectly crisp enough, and each bite well seasoned. Not pictured we also ordered the Pan Fried Pork Buns which were well made however a little plain for my liking... great with sauce! My friend also expressed that the Wonton Noodle Soup was also on the plain side however shared that it was well made and delicious with some additional condiments available at the table. The ambiance is simple and casual, a great option even on a busy Friday night downtown. To wash it all down, I really enjoyed my Passionfruit Iced Green Tea! So refreshing.

Beef noodle soup - 9.5/10 Also super flavorful! The meat is really tender and falls apart. The noodles could be chewier though, and we wish they had a tendon option haha.

Dan dan noodles - 9/10. We added a lot of chili oil and vinegar to add to the flavor, but it was really good! The peanut sauce is yummy af.

Shrimp wontons - 7.5/10. These were pretty mid compared to other restaurants', but nevertheless still enjoyable. The sauce was pretty plain.

Our complimentary popcorn chicken dish was the star of the show, but you can find it in every tapioca shop in the SGV. In the near future, I don't rule out vending machines offering tapioca. Although the wontons were okay, DTF definitely offers better tasting ones and certainly more variety.

On the other hand, I've noticed this place mainly serves Taiwanese/Chinese food that you can find at street vendors and small mom-and-pop shops in Taiwan.

You order everything at the counter, grab a number, and head to a table--where the service is prompt and food & drink is delivered expediently. We were checked on multiple times by the waitstaff to see if we needed anything additional.

They have an impressive selection of alcohol and cocktails -- we loved the three we tried (Walking on a Mountain Path in Spring, Seventh Fleet, and Love Boat). The Taru Milk Tea was a little stringy and could have been blended a little better. They have self-serve water, both regular and sparkling, which is impressively cold.

Everyone raved about the food and we split 8 dishes for 5 people, which was more than enough. The highlights were the Taiwanese Sausage, the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken, the Pork Belly Clamshell Bun (we could have ordered a second), the Sha Gua Mian (has a good amount of heat), and the Minced Pork on Rice. We also tried the Chive & Egg Pockets, the Beef Noodle Soup, and the Sautéed Seasonal Greens (bok choy). Nothing was bad, but the greens could have used a sauce or a touch of seasoning.

Seating was plentiful, both indoor and outdoor, and I believe they installed heaters just a few days after we dined.

The location itself is great. They have a nice protected outside area with shade and a fun modern inside. This was our first journey to Pine and Crane and we loved it.

As we walked inside we were greeted and were able to order quickly in the line where you do so before you sit down. Marcellina was so friendly and genuine - you get the feeling by talking with her that she's someone you've known for a long time in all the best ways! We honestly needed that today. She offered fantastic suggestions and let us take our time.

After we sat down our food was served quickly, within minutes, and each person that dropped off our food was nice, warm, and interacted with us like a close friend. Props to Emerald for checking in on us several times to make sure we were happy. We were! Now on to the main event, we ordered:

-- The Taiwanese popcorn chicken
-- Shrimp wonton
-- Pan fried pork bun
-- slack season noodles
-- Taiwanese sticky rice
-- Grass Jelly (Dessert)

We loved everything. Truly. But I'd say our favourites were the shrimp wonton (the vinegar based sauce is to die for), the Pan fried pork buns (come with 6), the sticky rice and the grass jelly (it has boba! Yum).

We'll be coming back for breakfast since it's a different menu and probably leave a review for that too. It's a hidden gem that shines in a neighbourhood with few other options to enjoy. Do yourself a favor and check out this chill spot!",5 star rating

It was easy to navigate the menu, the staff were more than willing to recommend menu items and answer questions, and the whole ambiance and vibe of the restaurant was very laid back and comfortable. Right when you walk in there are menus in the front and when you're ready, you order at the front register and you're given a number to choose a table to sit at. The food comes out pretty fast within the time you place your order and sit down. They have two types of water (sparking and still) for self service. I recommend using the sauces they provide on the table; our favorites were the homemade sambal sauce and chili oil! Highly recommend if you're first trying to get into Taiwanese food!

Sha Gua Noodles: 8.5/10 The noodles were bouncy and the flavor was almost like a szechuan spice but dialed down! Very yummy.

Dan Dan Noodles: 9/10 A classic Taiwanese and Chinese noodle dish. The dish was light and flavorful as sometimes some dan dan noodles are pretty heavy on the peanut sauce.

Shrimp Wontons: 9/10 The sauce paired with these shrimps wontons were phenomenal! Such a good appetizer (or main) for the table.

Pan Fried Buns: 7.5/10 The filling was a little bland however the bread itself was very good. We mixed their sambal and chili oil together to eat with the buns. We also took the buns to-go with the sauce and the buns soaked in the flavor and tasted even better than it first being served.",5 star rating

The breakfast menu ends at 11 and has a couple items that aren't on the lunch. The Fantuan is only only served for breakfast and is only in the DTLA location which was why we cane here. I loved the Fantuan! It the fried dough was crispy on the inside and the filling was decent.

We also got the pan fried pork buns and the portion was not bad for the pricing ($9). However. I've had better ones at more traditional Chinese restaurants, but nonetheless it was still good and not too greasy which sometimes can be a problem with this dish.

We also ordered slack season noodles, which was a bit smaller than expected (not pictured). But the flavor of the minced pork was good.

Lastly the drinks were also solid. I had the salted foam cold brew, which I highly recommend.

The ambiance is quite modern, and there is a ton of seating. You order up front when you enter the store and they bring the item out to you.

Ordered the Dan Dan noodles - bomb. Perfect peanut flavor and nood consistency. The cucumbers were a perfect touch. This was the main delight. I gobbled it up with chopsticks.

Shrimp dumplings - the amount of shrimp in the dumplings are great, just wish they went a little lighter on the oil for this one. Too oily.

Dan Dan Mien - 9/10 tasty, small spicy kick but not enough to make you sweat or need water, so it was good plus vegetarian

Rice Cakes & Mushrooms - 8/10 tasty good seasoning and good vegetarian option

Chive potstickers - 9/10 very tasty and full of filling; sauce goes amazing with it; each order is 4 pieces, pretty large though

Dou Hua - 8/10 tasty, and comes with the ginger syrup, would recommend with ice though, for some texture and coldness

I'm here to tell you that I come specifically for the Dou Hua (tofu pudding dessert). It is consistently delicious. The bowl is a very generous portion size, plenty for two to share. My order: Dou Hua, no boba, syrup on the side, and extra taro balls. The menu doesn't list boba as a topping, but it is (on ubereats, there's an option to remove boba). I don't like sweet, so syrup on the side (in a cute small beaker!) is perfect for me to adjust my sweetness level. The taro balls are sometimes sweet potato balls only. I love both so I don't mind. They're as chewy as you could imagine. The texture of the dou hua is also important to me. There's a thickness to it and it's not too easy to break the pudding apart. Perfect.

Pine and Crane is my go-to place when I'm craving a tofu pudding dessert. Eons better than meetfresh. Plus you get such a nice ambiance inside and friendly customer service. AND they're open til 10pm every single day. Doesn't get better than that.

Came for the first time about 6 months ago and have literally came in / ordered from postmates at least 15 times since then, we can't get enough! Everything is great, but the popcorn chicken is what keeps us coming back almost twice a week. My partner actually just went to Taiwan and we came to Pine & Crane the day after they returned and lo and behold...they said the chicken was just as good!! Seriously - get it.
Our other classics are the minced pork bowl and the mapo tofu. Both are wonderful, always super flavorful and filling. You can't beat price of the pork though - 9 dollars and it's enough for a full meal if you eat it on its own.
Smashed cucumbers are a nice refreshing side, the woodear mushrooms are good too!
Service is great and dine-in is always unbelievably fast. Like, 2 minutes after you sit you have your entire meal in front of you, fast.

First time, I didn't check the hours and assumed that they were opened for dinner time. Nope, they closed at 4pm. Second time, the restaurant was experiencing technology issues, so they were closed for the day. Third time, I was able to order and dine without issue. Restaurant aesthetics is gorgeous!

I feel sad leaving this comment because I'm full Taiwanese, grew up in Taiwan, and wanted to support this business. However, I am also a foodie and wanted to provide my honest review.

Food, overall, was extremely disappointing. Daikon rice cakes had absolutely no taste of daikon or shallots. The only thing I remembered from this dish is that it was way too crispy all around and for no good reason. Thousand layer pancakes... The dough that was used had zero seasoning. It was basically just egg, basil, and chili sauce wrapped in a flavorless tortilla. Kinda confused about the ingredients. Is there supposed to be a Thai-spin?

972,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pine-and-crane-dtla-los-angeles-3?osq=Restaurants,"Such a great venue, I was excited to hear they opened a larger spot with outdoor seating. The original location in Silverlake is a bit of a zoo, especially on the weekends, parking is atrocious and I don't think they ever had outdoor dining which is unfortunately during these covid times.

This new location is in a more quiet area of DTLA which is a nice change of scenery. I was originally nervous about being able to find parking because it can be a nightmare in DTLA but I was able to find a spot right across the street.

Much like the og spot, you order inside at the register, grab a number and find a seat. You can always order more once you have a seat as well which is nice so you don't have to keep going back to the front. The interior was spacious, with high ceilings (but still decent acoustics not like Bottega Louie where you literally have to yell across the table).

We, of course sat outside in their outdoor patio, they had lots of plants and flowers so it was quite lovely. We ordered a LOT of food to share, since we were there for my aunt's birthday and she is an eater. The first course randomly took the longest to come out- I ordered the beef roll and that took over 15 minutes to arrive (I was getting hangry lol). But we ordered the rest of the food and I thought it was going to take forever so I ran out to add money to my meter and apparently all of the food came out while I was gone!

This is what we ordered:

1) Beef roll- always a favorite, I love the crisp cucumbers in it- it feels lighter because of this even though you know that the exterior is fried. So good.

2) Dan Dan noodles- always love this dish too, love the peanut flavor and cucumbers again (plus garlicky sauce)-yum!

3) Pan fried Pork buns- love the combo of the fried bottom and fluffy top- how can you go wrong with large dumplings? We needed more protein so we ordered this.

4) Popcorn Chicken: it's little pieces of salty seasoned fried chicken, what's not to love? I also liked the fried thai basil leaves too.

5) Yu Choy- that was the seasonal greens- I love ordering this when it's an option since I feel like I can always eat bok choy anytime. Simple but tasty.

6) Taiwanese sticky rice- sadly not a big fan of this, I didn't think it had a lot of flavor but my aunt seemed to like it since it tasted familiar.

7) wonton soup for my aunt- it was a chilly day. I've had it before as well, the broth is mild but flavorful.

We were so hungry that day that I forgot to take photos of the food! But we barely had any leftovers so that should be plenty of evidence that the food was great.

I would highly recommend this new location, plus I love that they have more food options (at least I think than the og location and Joy).",5 star rating

Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken - Great flavor, good crunch. It's a decent portion, but the price seems to be a little high.

Panfried Pork Buns - The filling tasted great, but I'm not used to the bread/bun being so thick. The ratio took away from the awesome filling and made the dish as a whole quite heavy and laborious to get through.

That said, I will forever love this place and the family of chefs and workers behind it.

To say that it isn't worth it or too expensive, ask yourself, why do you think that? Do Mexican places always have to be food stands by the road to be good? Do Chinese places always have to be hole in the wall places that's under $10 to be good? Why can't we elevate our food - does that mean our people and younger generations continuing the legacy of Asian cuisine can't be paid more / undeserving of the same pedestals as French and other European cuisine?

The marinated beef with hosin sauce in the rolls already made the dish flavorful enough on its own, BUT if you wanna kick it up a notch, help yourself to some of the complimentary house-made chili oil (sitting on every table). If you don't do spice, try dipping it in a combination of soy sauce and vinegar (this is what we did and it was yummy).

If you're a party of two and it's cold out or you just want to drink something hot, get one of the hot teas. They serve it freshly brewed with two small cups and offer a couple refills of hot water. We got the Dong Ding tea and it was perfect for the meal.

The mochi is INSANELY good and a must have if you like black sesame or peanut butter/nutty flavors! It is fairly heavy especially after a big meal so take it to go if you have to, but definitely get it!!

The food has been consistently high-quality and tasty, the staff is friendly and professional, the interior it stylish and clean, ordering online is easy, and the price is fantastic.

I have yet to try something I don't like, but my favorites are the beef soup, shrimp & chicken wontons, bok choy potstickers, and popcorn chicken.

ambience: nice open spacing, however we came on a windy day so it was cold and there was no heaters. i went back to the car to grab my jacket, which luckily i had a puffer in my trunk.

service: food came quickly, order at the front and then self seating. water is in the back and self serve, they had complementary sparkling water, which was a nice touch and appreciated (i love sparkling water).

food ordered-
beef noodle soup: beef was tender and yummy. very good and hearty on a cold day.

taiwanese sticky rice: smaller than expected but still filling. was very hot and stayed warm throughout entire meal. i think there might have been peanuts in it? gravy thing on top was very flavorful.

wonton soup: medium size was small. i found myself full after eating wonton soup and half the sticky rice. the soup itself is a clear broth that felt very warm in my stomach and light. cleansing, but maybe a little bit too oily for my taste.",4 star rating

The hakka mochi is warm and almost gooey with half dusted with peanut flavoring and the other half with black sesame flavoring. This is tasty and lightly sweet. Good to share.

The minced pork on rice had a good flavor and there was a decent amount of pork to rice ratio. I liked the pickled daikon (wish there was a little bit more). It also has a hard-boiled soy-braised egg.

The shrimp wontons are a bit small but tasted fresh. They arrived in a flavorful sauce that I felt was overpowering. I would suggest asking for the sauce on the side.

The traditional shaved ice was pretty much melted by the time it arrived. It was packed on top of hot food. The paper bag it was packed in also tore due to the size and weight. Due to it's large size and that it is shaved ice, I think it should have been packaged separately and then the bags could be taped at the handles so it doesn't get separated. Since it has been pretty hot, I was really looking forward to this and was extremely disappointed. When I drank it, it did taste good. For the price (sized for two people or more).

Shrimp wontons: So disappointing. There was no flavor and was definitely steamed for too long.
Taiwanese sticky rice: I think it was a little heavy on the rice ratio, but it was good!

So much bigger, airier, and quicker. I was very much craving their mapo tofu, so I'm glad they still had that on the menu but many things are different than their silverlake spot so we got to try some new things too.

Went on a Sunday afternoon and there was a small line forming out the door, but it went very quickly. We let a family go in front of us while a friend was still parking. The SL wait can be long but this was a breeze in comparison. All the food came just as quickly too and we sat in the nice outdoor seating area.

The mapo I don't need to reiterate -- a perfect dish for this place. Paired with white rice it can't be beat.

The Sha Gua Main is a nice alternative to the Dan Dan noodles. A bit less peanuty which I appreciated, and no cucumbers for my husband who always eats around them in the dan dan. I liked the crunchy garlic on top too.

The popcorn chicken was superb. Tender dark meat, crispy fried outer shell. Delicious, only wish that I ordered 2.

Wonton soup was interesting. I'm a big fan of a classic wonton soup. Could have used a little more flavoring in the base, a nice miso maybe. Wish I had the option of doing pork wontons instead of shrimp too. The long noodles in the soup were honestly unexpected too. Haven't seen an udon noodle in a wonton soup before. I liked it as it was especially filling.

Got another order of shrimp wontons here too which were very good and delicate. Not my favorite item we ordered but no complaints about it either.

Dan dan noodles - 5/5!! Must try!! My favorite out of all the dishes we ordered. We got 2 orders to share between a party of 4.

Three cup jidori chicken - 3.5/5. Chicken was very tender and flavor was good but didn't blow my mind out of the water.

Panfried pork buns - I'm not usually a fan of this type of dish so I can't speak on it but my friends enjoyed it!

Popcorn chicken - 4/5. Pretty good! But I've had better since I grew up in the 626 area.

Spicy shrimp wontons - 4/5. Pretty solid shrimp wontons!

Hakka mochi - 5/5. The mochi was so soft and the sesame and peanut powder they used was so yummy. Definitely a great way to finish off a good meal!

Pine + Crane in DTLA has the vibe of a bright, airy, modern cafe but serves a menu of authentic Taiwanese dishes in a casual, counter service setting. We started with two small plates: the Smashed Cucumber Salad and Woodear Salad, both of which were lightly marinated, crunchy, and refreshing. The Panfried Pork Buns contained a filling of kurobuta pork and Taiwanese cabbage, wrapped in a chewy dough with a crispy, pan-fried bottom, all topped with chopped scallions and sesame seeds. Finally, we had the Beef Noodle Soup, made with noodles, sliced beef shank, and baby bok choy in a dark broth. The soup was on the salty side, but the braised beef shank slices were super meaty and tender, and the condiments that came on the table (including red chili sauce, vinegar, soy sauce) helped to balance out the flavors. After we were done with our meal, one of the servers surprised us with a complimentary dessert of Hakka Mochi, or chewy rice flour dumplings rolled in sweetened crushed peanut and black sesame powders.

Came in expecting to get breakfast, granted I showed up at 11 which is when breakfast service ends and I was told breakfast was no longer being served. After I place my order for Dan Dan Noodles I overheard the manager offer another customer breakfast, didn't make a big deal out of it just sat and waited for my food. My order came out a couple of minutes later so one star for fast service (mind you they gave me no utensils, no napkins, no condiments) but I live literally next door and when I tasted my noodles I'm not lying when I say these noodles were literally still slightly refrigerated/lukewarm. So I do what any normal person would do and went back and asked for another order which they politely agreed to.

However, when my food came out the manager asked me if I had ever had the noodles before, to which I replied yes I have. Then she proceeded to try to justify that the noodles are quoted a 10 minute ticket time but that they typically take 2-3 minutes to cook, to which I replied well I don't understand how that applies to this situation because I walked in and ordered to-go and received my food right away. She went on to try to explain that maybe between the time the food was packed and when I ate it got cold. Yet I've had fast food stay hotter over a longer period of time. I explained to her that food should always be served hot, bottom line. She then called me aggressive and hostile, and I said sure I am a little upset because of the aforementioned experience with breakfast as she kept saying ""yeah"" ""uh-huh"" in a very condescending tone.

On top of that there was a filthy terry towel in plain sight where they place everyone's to go orders, which I made her aware of and I pointed out how gross and dirty all her furniture was, which she didn't like at all. Her workers then started to harass me and tell me I was being rude. So I apologized and took accountability for my behavior and asked her to do the same about her condescending tone, and she literally told me it was ""in response to my behavior"".

Again. WOW.

Maybe I was just hangry, but this place has taken a complete nosedive, and I'm pretty sure like I'm most cases it's due to poor management. Went home and had to microwave my noodles Top Ramen style.

A bunch of us grabbed coffees which were surprisingly good given that this isn't really a coffee shop.

The chive and egg pockets were under seasoned but perhaps intentionally (vinegar/sauce made it perfect).

And of course, the fan tuan, the star of the show - the youtiao (Chinese donut) inside of it was a little hard, a sign of it being fried at least a day or so ago before being wrapped.

It's honestly a disgrace on Taiwanese food and our community. The buns are also lacking flavor. Dan Dan noodles are very mid as well but you could tell the noodles weren't fresh. When they came out it was all stuck together.

Service is mostly self serve. They tell you to get your own plates, utensils, and to go boxes.

They did well with the decorations. The outside features a lot of Asian beverages and snacks. However it's all just a facade. They create a warm and welcoming asian themed interior to trick you into thinking that the food would be worth its price but it really is not. Sorry but just head to a real Taiwanese / Chinese place.

This place is probably only acceptable if you haven't eaten all day and you went climbing or worked out right before. What also sucks is that I couldn't add any flavor from the provided ""soy sauce"". It's almost like they diluted it with water or something because it has 0 flavor.

- Shrimp Dumplings: yummy and packed with flavor. Has a slightt bit of heat in the sauce.

- Beef Noodles: delicious and the flavor of the broth was spot on. The bok choy was tough to cut and eat lol but the noodles and broth as well as the steak pieces was good.

- HIGHLIGHT * Fruit Shaved Ice: I cannot even begin to describe the deliciousness of this amazing dessert. The flavors just burst in your mouth. Who knew something SO SIMPLE can be SO AMAZING. The brown sugar syrup tied in with the strawberry/pineapples and the pudding creates a wonderful masterpiece. It was truly addicting.

Woodear mushroom (4/5) - refreshing, tender, great way to start our dinner

Mapo tofu (5/5) - delicious, very filling, great portion, the sauce is cooked to perfection and the tofu was welll cooked not too soft

Beef roll (5/5) - would get this again, I love the hoisin sauce and the sliced beef with crunchy cucumbers. Even thought the dish is quite heavy and filling, the lightness from the cucumber really balance the dish for me

Very cute interior, and a convenient spot, since food comes fast and there are some street parking around!",5 star rating

I was craving a simple taiwanese bfast that usually includes a rice roll (fan tuan), egg pancake (danbing), and cold soy milk.

Purple rice roll was small, dry, and not sticking together well. Egg pancake was more doughy. Soy milk tasted rubbery and bland despite the sugar, which is a first.

I think it's fun for small businesses to play with traditional menus from time to time, but I didn't think the purple rice and marinated egg was necessary in the rice roll. Neither was the corn in the egg pancake.",2 star rating

Everything we tried was delicious! Our personal favorite was definitely the beef roll. There's a nice sweetness to it that really pairs well with the richness of the beef. We also really enjoyed the shrimp wontons, as they came with a really flavorful house sauce.

I'm really excited the Pine & Crane opened a location that's closer to me on the east side of LA. I just wish parking was a little easier in this area, but overall, I can't wait to go back. The restaurant space is also super nice, with a beautiful outdoor section.",5 star rating

Food is pretty good too. I think it's definitely pricey for this kind of food, but it's LA after all and the portions are a good size. I also think it's best to come with a group of at least 3-4 people so you can try more things and make it worth it.

Our faves were the popcorn chicken and the three cup chicken. The pan fried pork buns and the beef noodle soup were tasty too. The things I didn't care for were the sea foam black tea (the boba was really mushy and i just didn't care for the flavor of the tea) with boba and the fruit shave ice (the ice wasn't fine enough and it was comparable to raspados).",4 star rating

Pine and Crane used to be a casual favorite for us during its first couple of years. We'd bring in friends from different cities to dine here but for some reason it just went down hill for us.

Interior and decor was very nice at this new location but no AC on the day we went and it felt so muggy inside, we just took our food home to eat. It's great they have outdoor seating too and the space is much larger than their original location.

It's located right below Aven apartments and we went around 3PM so luckily there was a spot to park but I can't imagine going during peak hours unless you walked and lived near by.

5. Order every dumpling. But if you can't - pan fried pork will have your taste buds bouncing like an iPad kid watching Cocomelon

The place was pretty much full inside, but empty on the patio.

I ordered beef noodle soup ($14) which honestly probably was the best I have ever tried. My partner ordered Taiwanese popcorn chicken ($13) and a pork belly clamshell bun ($5.5) which he liked as well.

The eclectic ambiance and friendly and helpful staff made our visit memorable and fun.

The only downside I would mention was a dessert. My friend ordered Forbidden rice pudding ($7) and we all agreed that it was a weird combo of ingredients, so one of the servers replaced it with Hakka Mochi ($8) which was also just ok (a bit dry and not too much flavor).

soft and moist.

The Daikon Rice Cakes were disappointing, as you couldn't taste the daikon, was quite bland.

The Ice Sweetened Soy Milk was great, you could taste the soy and the consistency and nice and thick. However, I don't think they mixed the sweetener in well, because the bottom of the drink was way too sweet to finish. (Make sure to thoroughly mix it yourself before drinking!)

We had some frustrating experiences there in our last couple of visits, with large variance in how the the dandanmian would taste from order to order, over-salted mapo tofu, etc.

Had given up on Taiwanese food closeby but I'm glad we gave it another shot.

Hakka mochi was solid, and missing it was the primary reason we came. Savoury soy milk wasn't as good, and was more expensive than places like Four Sea, but that can attributed to the price you pay for the location.

After our experiences at the Silver Lake location, the dandanmian here was a welcome return to what we had previously expected.

Beef rolls, chive pockets, and the seasonal greens were solid offerings.

Tea selection is reasonably priced for the quality and I appreciate the effort with providing a timer to measure steep time.

Keep coming back here and never get tired of their food.

Beef noodle soup and Dan Dan noodles are definitely my favorite things to order, but I tried almost all of the menu and everything they have is delicious! Really appreciate how they elevated the menu from Silverlake location.

Their brunch is great too! Fan Tuan is not your average breakfast, but I really enjoyed it. And sea salt cream cold brew is amazing!

The atmosphere is great too! Just need some heaters outside in the winter months.

And one of the most important things is that their prices are very reasonable! That's why I keep coming back.

Like the others, Great customer service and great taste of the foods is very important to me because it makes my day perfect !

So I decided to give this a place a try since I was craving for a Taiwanese foods, & I'm glad I did because the foods was so delicious & the service was great! Specially to WELL ~ Even though he wasn't the one who help me order my foods at the casher, he was so attentive on helping me and was very postive compared to the other guy (No offence), so giving this review a 5 stars was because of him

The Taiwanese Popcorn chicken was so freaking delicious and the level of spiciness was enough to satisfy you, unless you like super spicy, then you have to request that because they don't ask you the level of spice you want. Highly recommend it.

The Sha Gua Mian was pretty good too ! Love the presentation of it when it was first served on my table. The noodle is always taste better on spice so make sure to add more spice flavor on the side.

Not really a big fan of Buns, but their Pan fried pork bun was pretty juicy in the inside and perfect soft buns on the outside which was perfecto! Must try this too.

Wanted to order more different dishes because I saw there was so many delicious choices came out from the kitchen but I was so full, and so i will save those for the next visit !!!!

Tip for this restaurant, the Green black milk tea need update because I didn't taste the flavor, It was like drinking an ice water. Or it could be depending on the person who made it ????

- pan-fried pork buns, woodear salad, slack season noodle, beef roll

Service: pleasant and attentive

Food quality: fresh ingredients, but not really tasteful, Compare to other Asian-Chinese restaurants, I strongly feel they have a long way to compete with others.

The pan-fried pork buns and the woodear salad were tasteless, they both lack of flavor.

Price: food is reasonable but not the drinks

Ambience:: casual, open and modern, little loud but acceptable

No doubt, the restaurant's design is beautiful, however, the food tasted very so so. They missed all the authentic flavor?! I guess the chef wasn't Asian.

Seasoning is a key for Improving Flavor. It's unnecessary to put the space overly fancy, it may be an attractive selling point to attract people here, but not for me, I am a person whose only enjoy good food. Going further, please take a deep consideration and spending more time to THINK & ADDRESS how to deliver good taste, good food and good flavor.

Their vegetarian chive and egg pie was delicious, not too salty not too MSGy, the thickness of the dough was good.

Their minced pork over rice was on point, pork was a little dry but was good enough and they gave a decent amount of meat.

Their 3 cup chicken was not too salty, flavor was good and chicken was yummy.

Fried chicken was the best! Wood ear mushroom's flavor was good. As I'm writing this review I think their food was not too salty, which I liked.

The hot and sour soup was both sour and spicy enough, a bit too spicy for me but it's definitely good amount of both flavors.

The beef noodle soup was also very flavorful. Beef was tender.

1114,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pine-and-crane-dtla-los-angeles-3?osq=Restaurants,"From my previous visit to the Silverlake location of Pine and Crane, I was very impressed from the environment to the taste of the food. And hearing a second location in downtown opened a few months ago, I decided to take a trip to see how it compares to the original. Driving into downtown on a Saturday afternoon around 1PM, parking was particularly difficult as most of the street parking within one block was filled. But fortunately some of the perpendicular streets had more should you need to find a space.

Entering the restaurant, I noticed how light, open, and kinetic the furnishings were! The plants and light wood inside the restaurant made it feel like a modern Asian garden. With outdoor seating and large garage style doors, the space felt very open and created an exchange between the indoors and outdoors. And to top it all off, the lights were a warm yellowish, white color and were hung from the ceiling from lampshades, making the lights feel natural and non-imposing. After looking around, I took a menu from the pedestal and lined up to order at the cash register on the right side. From inspecting the menu, I realized that the menu had items unique to this location in addition to the regular items I've seen at the Silverlake location. And because of this, I figured I'd try one of the unique items here with the Three Cup Chicken costing $15.50 at the time of this review. I then was given a number stand and selected a table.

**Notes:

1) Still water and sparkling water are offered for FREE at this location! To get some, simply walk to the back left of the restaurant, grab a metal cup and fill using the taps. Spout on the left is for still and spout on the right is for sparkling.**

The food ended up hitting my table VERY quickly! After sitting, I got up to use the restroom and grab some water. By the time I got back, my food was waiting for me! For a more complex dish such as the three cup chicken, I expected it to take longer. But the fact they could crunch out a dish in that amount of time really shows how devoted they probably are. Looking at the dish, the first thing I could see was chicken, chicken, chicken! Though the pieces of chicken didn't appear to be too large, looks can be deceiving as each piece of chicken was dense with meat. Somehow, the food ended up lasting a meal and a half which was pretty good all things considered. Ratio wise, chicken took up about 70% and basil, onions, and garlic took up the other 30% which I would consider to be fair at the price point. A side of rice was also included, which was also appreciated. For $15.50 in DTLA, the price was not bad side. But coming in, you know you're paying for environment in addition to food.

Consuming the food, it's possible that the three cup chicken just wasn't my cup of tea. But it was pretty good overall and not bad by any means. The chicken tasted of a light soy sauce and white vinegar (though it was sesame oil and rice wine). When it came to texture however, I felt the chicken was either a tad dry or was white meat chicken. This doesn't necessarily mean it was bad as this could be how the dish is prepared. But for my personal taste, it did come as a curveball. Fortunately though, the chicken tasted better with the rice as the grains were fluffy and moist, transferring the moisture over to the chicken. Moving down the list, the chives had a strong herbal flavor, though it never dominated the dish by any means. Elaborating, mixing the chives with the garlic and sauce at the bottom capped that flavor and filtered it in a way that allowed certain aspects like the sourness to come through.

Service here felt kind, patient, and personalized! From the cashier at the front making casual conversation to the servers who openly insisted they correct their mistakes, I felt taken care. When one of the servers mistakenly dripped some sauce on my brown to-go bag, she apologized sincerely and went to get another one. But the one part that really made this experience above in beyond was a free dish. As I was eating, a server put down an order of pan fried pork buns. Seeing that I never ordered it, I informed her and she took it back to check with the staff. She came back a few minutes later telling me that it was a gift! Though I wasn't sure who gave it, I assumed it was the house. Because it was gifted I will not be reviewing it, but it is nice when things like this happen every once in awhile.

Everything from the food to the environment screamed hip and upscale, emphasizing the idea that you don't need to dish out bundles to have a good experience. Because of the warm service, uniquely up-to-date ambiance, and tasty food, my experience was memorable and tops out at 5 stars. Though the Three Cup Chicken wasn't my forte, I'll be trying other items on their menu when I return in the future. Great job! No other words needed.",5 star rating

The decor was really nice. The wait staff was super friendly. We had to order at the kiosk.

The menu was small. I had no issues with my order. If I had choice between din tai fung. I'll choose din tai fung.

It was an experience. I though the owner was super friendly. Taiwanese are known for they're hospitality. Except in MPK. Huge tree pantry. The dad and daughter both yelled at me. It was normal for me because well I'm the C word. You can't escape the yin yang of mean people.

I think the menu is missing chinese. If I ever have to bring my parents or other relatives from the motherland. There are going to be issues with that. I'm more used to have the menu in chinese and english. To cover all bases. Traditional chinese. Not simplified. Onegai

I liked the experience. Felt very hipster. Like ABC style. Which I like since I'm American. Which is our culture. Not the motherland or taiwans.

I sure miss the free parking you get in SGV though. I live in the more chinese side of LA where even like 3 year olds speak full blown cantonese or mandarin. Or whatever language they feel like they're village language.

I call this place like taiwanese dim sum. I like going to monjataiker more because the workers always speak mandarin. Bu dong wo de ying yu. Wo sie le....

The super sweet guy working the register had me try the Beancurd Clamshell Bun and it was delish! The steamed bun is like biting into a cloud and the pickles mixed with bean curd have a nice sweet and tangy contrast. Was giving pulled jackfruit vibes but 1000 times better.

The Dan Dan Noodles are if you like a peanut sauce. Super filling and only $9 !!

Lastly the Hakka Mochi was absolutely divine. Little balls of fresh warm mochi rolled in powdered peanut heaven.

Order these 4 things and you will have an incredible time, you're welcome.",5 star rating

D D noodles, smashed cucumber salad, fried pork buns, S/S soup and sticky rice. Pork buns my favorite, D D noodle was good but not a fan of creamy noodles, coming from ramen noodle fan. Food came quick and service was great. I wud return for the pork buns and try other items on the menu, street parking no problem after peak lunch period.

We've been to the Silver Lake and the Highland Park locations, but this downtown location could be our favorite. The space is stunning, very open and airy, lots of clean air, and the service is superb. We can't wait to go back, and being that we live downtown, we will come here often.

Beef noodle soup is so good. Rich, depth of flavor, and noodles are delicious. Shrimp won ton soup, wood ear mushrooms, and the sesame mochi, not to mention the cream green ice tea.. All so so so so good!!! The sesame mochi, I will dream of this dessert, it melts in your mouth, comfort food.....

Pine and Crane is always a delight. We are always going to the SGV for different styles of Chinese food, but always come back to Pine and Crane as their food is so subtle, clean tasting, fresh, and flavorful...

My son and daughter-in-law really love the food so we were determined to try this place out!

I had the Slack Season Noodles and my wife had Three Cup Chicken with brown rice. The kids had vegetarian dishes plus some sides to share like bok choy potstickers which were yummy with bean curd and shiitake. The Slack noodles have a ""fortified"" pork broth and it lived up to my expectations. Very deep flavor, pork bits very savory and a perfectly cooked (steamed?) shrimp on top.

As usual, I reached over to my wife's Three Cup Chicken and grabbed a forkful or two. Highly recommended!

The price is decent price for some of the their items.
The large wonton soup is a good size and comes with a lot of wontons for the price. Definitely very filling and hearty on a cold day. It is bland, but you can easily add some black pepper or chili oil to give it more flavor.
The popcorn chicken is not worth it in my opinion for the price. It isn't very presentable either and doesn't come with much. Not worth the value.
I would not recommend the sea salt caramel coffee unless you enjoy black coffee. I added sweetener afterwards and it was no use and got a green tea as a replacement.
The shrimp wontons were good but not great. Again like the soup it was more on the bland side but dipping it in soy sauce and chili oil helped.
Overall, it was a decent spot to grab and go when you're in a rush and not expecting too much. I def had better places in OC but for convenience you pay for in flavor sometimes.",3 star rating

I heard Pine & Crane opened a new place in DTLA so I have decided to come to check it out. The food tasted amazing with some signature dishes like the popcorn chicken, spicy wonton, dan dan noodle and everything.

The pork belly was cooked just right, no dried out meat nor was it undercooked. The pork flavor was well suited to the rest of the bun, though a couple of things that might dissuade you from getting it is that the pork belly is pretty oily and only one bun costs $5.50 as of January 2023

Moving onto the main dish, the Dan Dan Noodles were outstanding! A great base for the broth is used, the noodles are chewy but not overtly so and the peanuts and vegetables were fresh and flavorful. The dish is about $10, so it's a pretty good value.

Panfried Pork Buns (4.5/5): I believe this is their signature dish and it's definitely worth getting. Only complaint is there was way more bun than filling but still delicious nonetheless.

Sha Gua Mian (4/5): Surprisingly simple but I liked the chili oil flavor of this dish. I wouldn't call this spicy but has a kick for good measure. I wished the noodles were more al dente but overall still good.

Either way, I was expecting Pine and Crane to be good but definitely not THIS good. The prices are not bad at all for what you get. It's a cute aesthetic open space in DTLA - the entrance is super big and open like a garage door and there's outdoor and indoor seating. There's street parking you can find in front for on the side/behind the block. Free on Sundays. I shared with a few friends since we wanted to try everything and everything was so good. We got the Dan Dan noodles, the beef rice bowl, beef roll and shrimp wontons. The noodles were intricately flavored and had peanuts sprinkled over it, the rice bowl was really authentic and definitely not made with anything less than 100% quality. The beef roll is wrapped in a scallion pancake and it wasn't overly salty -- The whole meal was just so quality, so flavorful and was above and beyond expectations. The shaved ice for dessert (classic) was also really great, definitely enough for four people to share.

Been here 2x in the past week and the dishes I tried have all simply been YUM! I've never been to pine and crane in Silver Lake even though I lived in the neighborhood but I could not be happier that they're in my new neighborhood. The restaurant decor is modern, simple and welcoming, and the hand painted mural outside is a beautiful touch.

1194,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pine-and-crane-dtla-los-angeles-3?osq=Restaurants,"The Dan Dan Noodles & Hakka Mochi we're the best things we ordered here. The noodles were coated in a rich peanut sauce and the flavor was spot on. The mochi was perfectly soft that we couldn't get enough of it in its yummy black sesame/peanut powder. I would say these 2 dishes tasted the most authentic.

The chrysanthemum tea was a nice pair to our Hakka mochi dessert and I liked that they kept filling up our tea pot with hot water. I highly recommend ordering a tea with the mochi since the sesame/powder could make you a little thirsty.

The Pan fried baos & egg & chive pocket were a hard no. I've had my fair share of pan fried baos and egg & chive pockets in the 626 area and both dishes seriously lacked flavor and depth. The baos were dry and had no juice. The egg & chive pocket had an overwhelmingly amount of black pepper served with a very underwhelming hot sauce. Dare to say... disgusting? Simple chili oil and black vinegar did the trick, but we weren't impressed. Yes, both dishes were nicely fried and crispy, but the filling was missing something.

The service was great and attentive and the atmosphere was very inviting. Loved the open air indoor/outdoor seating. BUT one thing that was a deal breaker for me was the amount of gnats that was surrounding our food and table throughout the duration of our meal. It was utterly freaking annoying! How gross is that they are landing on my food?! My sister and I killed about a handful each and constantly had to swat them away! It totally killed the experience and the servers apologized as they saw our frustration, but they said it was out of their control.

As yummy as the dan Dan noodles & Hakka mochi were, I'm not sure if I will return. There were too many downside variables that outweighed the positives. I drove way away thinking to myself, ""eh... that was aiite"".",3 star rating

1197,https://www.yelp.com/biz/pine-and-crane-dtla-los-angeles-3?osq=Restaurants,"I did a takeout/pick-up order, but wow- what an open and airy space! I love all the natural light coming in as well.

One organizational critique- it's not immediately obvious that if you're doing a pick-up order, that you don't have to wait in line up front, but instead there's a separate area for that.

In terms of service, the timing of the order was great and on time. However, the kitchen missed two of my special requests. First, I asked them to pack all of the condiments (sauce and veggies) , but instead got noodles and veggies in one container and just sauce in a second container. (Perhaps it was just a different interpretation of what I meant by condiments in my request, so I'm not going to ding them too hard on that one.). Second, I requested the dou hua to be plain but it still came with the boba, red beans, etc. (which is why I only went 4 stars instead of 5).

For the food:

Pork Buns
- Nice and thin skins, that were a mix of chewy and crisp in all the right places. If that doesn't make sense, think of a pan fried dumpling where the bottom is crispy and crunchy, while the sides are more soft and chewy. Eaten on their own, the skins are a little bland, which I presume is some of where the 'bland' comments are coming from. I found the filling to be adequately seasoned, and with the right amount of juiciness. Also, there's only a minimal gap between the skin and filling which is good to see. The scattering of scallions and sesame seeds are a nice touch as well.

Dan Dan Noodles

- Delicious, but considering how much sauce they give you, they really need to give you more noodles. I got my noodles well coated well enough to completely change the color and leave residual sauce on my plate, and I still had almost half of the container of sauce left!

Dou Hua

- A word of warning here for anyone that is looking for a purely traditional rendition (e.g. it's
not the version you usually see at dim sum and such). This is NOT it. You receive a bowl of dou hua that is topped in a mix of red beans, boba, and additional mochi/glutinous rice dumpling type toppings. The latter are advertised as being yam/sweet potato and look the part, but if you were expecting actual yam/sweet potato, that's not what you'll be getting.

I also got mine topped with egg pudding which is so exceptionally smooth and creamy!

The ginger syrup has the right amount of sweetness and a nice ginger kick.

The dou hua itself is fairly smooth, but still not as silky smooth as what you used to be able to get at some of the best dim sum places.

Also, not sure if this was the case because I got it with egg custard, but the dou hua is served lightly chilled. I didn't mind given that it's summer, but I was expecting it to be a hot version (just a note of caution so people know what they're getting).",4 star rating

I checked it out to see if this location was so, but unfortunately, it was not. The other reason on trying out this place is because of their selection. Seems to be more than the silver lake. Let's start with the positives about this place. The interior/ambiance is definitely roomier with the inside/outside eating area combined with their stylish deco. They have their unique booths sets spread out throughout out their dining. But all of this is where about the positives end. Just like how another reviewer put it, ""it is a soul-less"" counterpart of their sister silver lake location. From the cash register. Just a soul less creature seemingly to not wanting to be there. You guys don't have servers so this position should have all the knowledge into her brain. More training from management. As for the food, that extra umph/love that exists in silver lake doesn't exist. Ordered the bok choy potstickers, wood ear and mian noodles. It was good but not as great as the other location. First time ordering the mian and boy it's small. The food comes out really fast though. What I do like about this location is that they have a sparkling water station.

Environment is a relaxed yet modern and beautiful with plants, light wood, and an almost industrial vibe. Great for any casual occasion.

FOOD: Hope to one day go through the whole menu, but I've tried the pan-fried buns, beef roll, peanut noodles, and all have been so delicious. But I could only order one thing, it'd be the beef roll (and I don't even like beef). I don't like food thats too salty, oily, or saucy, and everything I've tried has been just right. Definitely recommend going family style and ordering a lot of different items to taste and share with the table.

PRICE: Super affordable, especially for the food quality and environment. Everything on the menu ranges about $7-15.

SERVICE: Nearly everything is self-serve, including ordering, seating, utensils, water, etc. except the food itself, which is served by staff. Almost a fast-food setup where you order and pay at the register then self-seat. Food comes out super quick, even when the restaurant is busy.

As soon as we walked into Pine & Crane, I knew I was going to love it. Not only is the space beautiful, the ordering simple (you pay upfront and just get to sit down and eat!), and the menu full of favorites, the prices are actually reasonable for the generous portions they serve.

My friend and I ordered the wonton noodle soup, the pan-fried pork buns, the crushed cucumber salad, and the hakka mochi. My friend loved the wonton soup, and I was obsessed with how juicy and crisp the pork buns were! Our crushed cucumber salad was super refreshing, and one of the servers literally had it ready for us before we even sat down. The hakka mochi was a standout for me--I love mochi served warm, and the dusting of peanut and black sesame added such a great toasty, nutty flavor.

This place has some of the best customer service I've experienced in LA. Possibly anywhere. The staff were all super attentive without ever being overbearing. Our hostess was friendly, and the multiple servers who checked in on us outside were unfailingly kind and personable. We sat in the adorable outdoor area because it was pretty high-energy inside--a testament to how popular this place is!

As if they hadn't already won us over, the staff actually gave us free food?!?!?! Absolutely made my week. We couldn't stop talking about how sweet they were for the rest of the day. I totally stuffed myself and still had leftovers for dinner, which reheated perfectly.

FOOD
Unfortunately the food was a let down - the biggest issue - everything has sugar added to it and is unnecessarily sweet...why?? I don't want sweet dumplings or noodles.

The second biggest issue, I received cold noodles. And I was to nervous to say anything so poked away at a few mouthfuls before abandoning our food.

Which brings me to my next point...

SERVICE
I don't mind the set up of having to order first and wait, however when we arrived, we had no idea what to do...and stood around wasting time for ages. Please have clear signage or at least a host that guides you.

Our waitress seemed really annoyed at having to work. We asked for water, she said it was self service and quickly spun around and stormed off before we could ask where the water was. Every question was answered with frustration so we just stopped asking/expecting service. So when we got cold food, we just lived with it.

I had the woodear salad, dan dan noodles, and beef noodle soup. I was craving savory food and everything here was so filling. I don't have anything bad to say about pine & crane.

Smoked Kanpachi Tostada - $9 Our FAVORITE dish, you just have to get it!! The fish was smoky and fresh topped with massive scallops that melted in your mouth. We were left wanting to order a second ko one!

Tostada de Jurel - $9 Really liked the chili oil & yellowtail!! Smoked kanpachi was better imo.

Baja Fish Taco - $5 My favorite one (surprisingly) the fish was generous and batter was perfectly light and crispy.

Scallop Taco - $8 Scallops were melt in your mouth soft. Really good as well.

Taco de Pulpa - $7 My boyfriend's favorite taco, the octopus was surprisingly so so soft but still had a bit of bite.

The lemonade felt freshly made and it came in a huge mason jar. They also have a flight of homemade hot sauces on the counter, where we sat and watched all the prepping and how things were made.

I felt fine after indulging all the decadent food from Holbox.

The dishes ordered were on the spicy side and I do love my spice to kick it up a notch.

The tacos were flavorful and they're not skimpy on the portion.
The seafood tasted fresh and it gave me a WOW on the first bite with all these flavors mixed in together partying in your mouth.

It's located in a food haul type of setting inside a building with plenty of parking in the lot.
They have seating in the bar and I actually quite enjoyed it as I could see all the actions of the prepping.

It's one of eight restaurants inside Mercado La Paloma. There are seats at the counter or you can grab a table in the common area near by.

We ordered a ceviche and some oysters to share. And we each ordered some tacos and tostada. Every single item we ordered was so fresh and delicious. The flavors were so alive with plenty of acidity and their homemade hot sauces. The real star of the show was the live urchin & scallop ceviche. The live urchins were just delivered from Santa Barbara when we were about midway through our lunch. It's our lucky day because the urchins that day were huge! Even the chefs were saying they don't usually see urchins this big. The fresh urchins tasted super sweet. Def a must order item.

It's located within a food court with a small parking lot in the outside. Luckily we were able to snag a parking spot. Even walking in, you can see a sizable line of people waiting to order at Holbox (really speaks to its popularity inside an already bustling food court). Love how they give complimentary chips and salsa with a variety of hot sauces to try! The combination is so simple but so good - can't go wrong.

We tried a lot of the different tacos and entrees. Really loved the tenderness of the grilled octopus. The sauce was yummy and paired very nicely with the smokiness of the octopus. I think I preferred the octopus as an entree rather than the taco, which was more dry and crispy. We also ordered the tuna ceviche, which was fresh but nothing that different from some other places. The uni and scallop comes in two halves of one large uni. Very very sweet uni pieces with pieces of scallops, which added more texture and flavor.",4 star rating

My brother & his wife were in town and we've been taking them around CA. This past Thursday, we took them to NHM and by noon we were done so we decided to go to Holbox. My sister goes here a lot she says everything is good here, not just Holbox. Another friend of ours claims it is ""the best seafood [she's] ever tasted"". Exag? We shall see!

We got there close to 1pm, and the parking lot was still crowded. It also took us a few mins to find a table but most were done with lunch. We took turns guarding the table to order some food. I had my sister order the 2 fish tacos, ceviche deal for me plus an order of octopus and scallops for us to share. The rest got shrimp tacos, more ceviche, and tamale, beef tacos platanos and cochinetas from Chichen Itza, Holbox sister company. I got cucumber watermelon juice from the stall across for $5.70 (they mostly had drinks and desserts).

My favorites were basically from Holbox: adored the ceviche, the fish tacos were mouthwateringly good (my friend did not lie!) but my absolute favorite was the smoked fish taco. They came with a really complex sauce and the grape tomatoes in the tacos gave it a brightness. Its tacos like youve never had before.

I personally like tacos but I don't crave Mexican cuisine like all the other Angelinos do. That might change now.

Also we had the scallops. The octopus came with a side of green rice over beans. These were so good too. The ceviche was addicting and had avocado-cream drops on the side that just mixed so well.

The Chichen Itza food was good but was prepared with much less flair than Holbox. Its great to know tho that if you have folks in your group who aren't into seafood, they have other options in this place. Holbox is all seafood, and Chichen is all meat.

There is also a Thai food stall, burgers, also a small store and alterations stall. I didnt even notice the other stalls on the left side. There is much to explore in this amazing little hole-in-the-wall. I will be back for sure!

KANPACHI & UNI TOSTADA: My bf described this as the scene in Rattatouille where Anton has a flashback to his childhood LMFAO. Evidently, the composition of the tostada was strikingly reminiscent to the ones his mom made in his childhood (of course, upgraded). So fresh & bright, very savory and well balanced. May be biased bc we love uni... We ordered 2 more after this LOL

For the location and ambiance, food is a bit pricey. But the quality is what you're getting. We got a mixed ceviche that came with octopus, yellowtail, and shrimp. We also got two tostada, one with yellowtail and uni, and the other with yellowtail only. The tostada is homemade, and it was so crispy! I also liked the sauce they added to the yellowtail tostada - the spicy oil crisp were an amazing combination with the fish. They provide unique salsa on the side to add to their food, but honest not needed for their tostada and cevhiche items.

We were also lucky that the line was nonexistent when we ordered because I noticed that after ordering, the line was nonstop out the door. Of course a sign to a great food spot in itself.

Ordered a baja fish taco, smoked kanpachi tostada, and a taco de pulpo en su tinta. Goodness gracious were all three items so good. The flaky fried fish taco melted in my mouth, the texture of the octopus was soft and moist, and the smoked kanpachi was fresh and delicious. I doused each bite of the tacos and tostada with both of the Holbox habanero sauces. The sauce flight has 5 sauces all ranging in spice and flavor and the two habenero sauces were my fav. Something tells me you can't go wrong with anything on the menu here.

I arrived around 5:30 on a Sunday and the place was already almost at full capacity inside. They do have outdoor seating available as well but I can see the entire place getting full if you come during peak hours.

The food in contrast to the casual vibe of the shopping mall is what you would find at a fine dining establishment based on the flavors, thoughtfulness of each dish, and the presentation. If you're craving high-quality seafood-focused Mexican/Latin-American cuisine, this is your spot. Most of the dishes highlight RAW seafood, which was what I was craving that day.

*Ceviche de Pescado - ceviche featuring the fish of the day. Lucky for me, it was yellowtail which is one of my favorites. In addition, had pieces of octopus and shrimp. The portion was HUGE, seasoned well, had brightness from the citrus, and was served with a couple pieces of tostada. Perfect for sharing between 2-4 people.

*Smoked Kanpachi Tostada - the smokey flavor of the kanpachi really came through and gave the dish a nice contrast to the other things we ordered. Also included were big chunks of raw scallops, cooked shrimp, and diced red onions on top of a peanut-based sauce.

*Tostada de Atun - the blue find tuna ceviche was creamy and well-balanced. The tomatoes and diced onions were a smart move as it would have been too rich with just the avocado.

*Scallop Taco - this was the only cooked dish we had. The diver scallop was cooked to PERFECTION! The marinated fennel brought an elevated touch to the taco. Again, another well-balanced bite with the addition of the caramelized onion and tomato.

*Scallop Aguachile - loved how punchy this was from the abundance of lime juice. The bay scallops were sweet, great texture, and the citrus was tamed with avocado slices and diced onion.

*Mascarpone Cheesecake - was more dense than I would have imagined but still delicious! Did not enjou the strawberry sauce though, had a weird flavor. The swirls of chocolate were a nice touch.",5 star rating

Came here right when it opened at 11:30 am and there was already a short line. We were able to sit at Holbox's counter seats though, being there that early. That was clearly the right move, as within 30 minutes the line was literally out the door!

Ordered a host of items, including the Kanpachi and Uni Tostada, Live Urchin & Scallop Ceviche, Taco de Pulpo, Baja Fish Taco, Scallop Taco, and Ceviche Mixto. If I had to pick my favorite, I would marginally go with with the Kanpachi and Uni Tostada as it did not skimp out on kanpachi or uni. But honestly, everything here was fantastic! Seafood was mega fresh across the board. You can tell they put a lot of thought into designing this menu. All the menu items had great flavor and creativity. For the price, I thought the portions were more than fair.

I tried almost everything on the menu, including various tacos, tostadas, ceviches, and aguachiles. I even had their tasting menu, and I absolutely enjoyed every one of the dishes. I liked the Mejillones which was mussels with blue corn chochoyotes and crab chile rojo sauce was so good. But if I had to pick just one or two items off their regular menu, it would definitely be the Taco De Pulpo En Su Tinta and Baja Fish Taco. I love these two so much that I literally come to Holbox just for these two. These tacos are packed with flavors--savory but just acidic enough to satisfy everyone's palate. I love the soft texture of octopus, and it goes well with any one of the hot sauces they have on the counter. It is not mushy, but just right. Baja Fish Tacos are also crispy, but not nearly as greasy, at all. I love the crisp cabbage in it, which amplifies the crispy texture overall.
 
I also got to try the k i nn x Holbox Collaboration, and that was super delicious as well. To name a few, Abalone Tamale, Pozole and Stuffed Cabbage were memorable!
 
Don't forget to order the Sparkling Lemonade. It's not too sweet, but very refreshing and perfect with your meal.

We were served complimentary fresh chips and salsa and our orders were quickly taken - the staff were efficient and quick to accommodate. The ambiance was fantastic and I think it being in an open air food stall really elevated the entire experience.

The seafood was incredibly fresh - there is a lot of citrus in their raw dishes so if you're not used to it you'll be in for a pleasant surprise. My personal favorites were the Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta, Scallop Taco and Filete al Carbon.

Excitedly, we ordered way too much food for my boyfriend and I. We ordered a Scallop Agua Chile, a Smoked Kanpachi Tostada, a Opah Tostada, and Two Surf Clams, diced into a ceviche mix. There are 4 homemade sauces to choose from to ramp up the spice and flavor which I love. Best hot sauces ever! My favorites were the Chile Kut (roasted habanero) and Arbol-Pepper. Every order comes with a small bag of salted tortilla chips.

Scallop Aguachile (4/5): Soft and small but bite sized pieces of scallop dressed with a serrano lime marinade. I tasted a little too much peel of the lime, so it made it a little bitter. I reached for this the least, however, It had an amazing flavor.

Tostadas (4/5): The opah had a rich and creamy texture to the fish when it's raw. It was really nice with the tostadas but I could have them more chopped up. The kanpachi was smokey and definitely my favorite of the two.

Surf Clams (5/5): So tender and served straight in the clam shell! The chef prepared it two ways, in a coctel marinade and ceviche mix.

The chefs prepared the food fast and the quality delivers. They also offered more tostadas for our big order. It was one of my favorite places in LA when I visited!",5 star rating

The moment I walked in, there were many other restaurants but Holbox by far had the most people waiting in line. From the outside, you couldn't even tell there was a food court in the area but I'm so glad there is!

One of the more unique and tasty tacos they serve is the smoked kanpachi, as it tastes more like a flavorful taquito. I was told Holbox either has a Michelin star or is Michelin Guided so I had big expectations. Overall I think their tacos are fantastic and can definitely see the appeal. However, I have had fish tacos that taste similar to Holbox. When compared to San Diego's fish tacos, Holbox would fit right in, but being in the middle of a bustling city like DTLA does wonders for how good the quality is in the respective area. With that being said, I believe there are many other fish taco spots in San Diego that are just as good as Holbox. For those who haven't had really good quality fish tacos, I can see Holbox's appeal. On another note, their tacos are a bit pricey ranging from $6-8 and they are relatively small when compared to many other spots in San Diego.

I wouldn't say this place is a 'must try' in LA, but if you are local to the area, it definitely earns its spot for being one of the best restaurants.",4 star rating

I had pulpo taco which came with strips of octopus tentacles so it was a little bit chewy, but very delicious. The pulpo taco was good and different. It's so rare to find octopus taco so I HAD to get it.

The fried fish tacos were really good and probably one of my favorites I've had in the LA region. I love that there was a good portion of fish and the tacos had filling of sauce, tomato and lettuce.

The ceviche mixto is perfect for sharing! It comes with a mix of octopus, shrimp and bass; and everything was absolutely fresh. The dish is served with fresh chips.

Stepping into Holbox is like wandering into the United Nations of food - a small but mighty food court that's bustling with culinary diplomacy. Among the global delegates, the Baja Fish Tacos stand out like a diplomat who knows just the right thing to say: simple, eloquent, and incredibly satisfying. These tacos aren't just good; they make you ponder why every fish taco can't be this great.

The ambiance? Imagine a cozy indoor bazaar filled with the delicious chaos of competing scents, each stall vying for the title of ""Next Great Lunch Stop."" It's like a foodie theme park without the long lines for rides.

Plus, the server had great service with a never-ending supply of free chips and salsa, turning each order into a mini fiesta on the house.

1386,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Located in Mercado La Paloma (which essentially feels like, if not in fact a food hall) near USC campus (Fight On! haha). I came in on a Saturday night and the place was crowded with a long line. Luckily I had a reservation for an event (more on that below). The dishes here are influenced by the coastal regions of Mexico with an obvious nod to the Yucatan Peninsula (restaurant name from an island in that area). They focus on local ingredients and are sourced from SoCal and Baja California. The beauty of this place is that the food is thoughtful, purposeful, beautifully presented, and feels elevated, yet feels accessible and not stuffy at all. You can tell the folks and chef here love their craft through the interactions you get when you visit and in the food itself.

So...I've bookmarked this place and been wanting to go since I saw them on an episode of 'Worth It'...then they kept getting accolade after accolade and it got me worried about being able to eat here. I seriously was so close to booking myself a reservation for the reasonably priced tasting menu as a treat to myself for my birthday...then an opportunity presented itself. A collaboration dinner private event came up where for a slightly higher price than the regular tasting menu, you get some steak dishes that aren't usually on the menu and UNLIMITED BYOB (because event was located in a closed off room). For me it was a no brainer and the dominoes started to fall as 11 friends that are fellow beer/ wine enthusiasts joined on. With each of us bringing different wines/beers/sake...this was shaping up to be an epic culinary experience and night. And it was! I would've given this place 5 stars for the tasting menu itself (Holbox only items)...but with this experience, It's a 5++ haha.

First course - self service bar with two types of oysters and raw scallops on a shell. So good and fresh, and great with the fixins provided on the side. At this point, we opened some natural wine, a Henriot Champagne (96 vintage) Cuvée des Enchanteleurs Brut, a Raventos i Blanc Cava, and some light, sour beers from Floodland Brewing using different grapes.

Sea urchin and seabass ceviche - beautiful dish with delicious /fresh Santa Barbara sea urchin and Baja seabass. Great balance with textures and flavors here. This paired well with the stuff we had open, especially the champagne and cava. Additionally opened a 2006 Corto Charlemagne Grand Cru (Domaine des Croix)

Scallop aguachile - such beautiful presentation and great tart flavor from the citrus. This dish probably had the biggest kick. Felt like I was eating tasty artwork. A surprisingly great pairing here (at least for me) was a Tamanohikari Junmai Daiginjo sake. Pretty much perfect - it cut through the spice for more balance. Who would've thought sake goes well with raw seafood? Huh.

Bluefin tuna tostada - avocado puree and arbol-peanut sauce - the explanation on the tostada was fascinating and there's a whole process behind it. The peanut sauce gave it a little savory-ness to the taste profile. I made sure to open the 2021 Aurore Dezat ""Les Chasseignes"" Sancerre here with notes of lime.

Wagyu taco - Miyazaki wagyu striploin with a delicious char along with familiar avocado and tomato flavors. One of the items I don't think is available on the normal tasting menu. We started opening the 'reds' including a 2012 cabernet from HL Vineyards, a syrah, and a grenache.

Tomahawk steak and roasted fingerling potatoes - grilled perfectly medium rare and the potatoes were firm. Another course that was part of the collab and not on the regular menu. The reds we had open carried into this course and matched so very well.

Kanpachi al carbon - Omega Azul baja kanpachi grilled to perfection over mesquite served with avocado, pico de gallo, fluffy handmade tortillas, and delicious rice and beans. Since, this was the last course, we had a bunch of stuff open at this point, but opened up a Hakkaisan Daiginjo Sake, a Beringer Chardonnay, and some more grape featured Floodland beers. My friend also opened up a 1985 vintage Taylor Fladgate port wine at this point...holy moly!

In terms of the food, the chefs/people behind it, the company, and the drinks we had, this probably secured its place in my Mt. Rushmore of dining experiences.

Parking - I would suggest the lot, but there was some street parking as well. The further away, there was more street parking, but area might be sketch to most, so lot is best bet. I wasn't driving, but there was a small lot, but if you drive through the back corner (kind of hard to see at night; we followed other cars), it leads to a back lot that seems to have plenty more parking.",5 star rating

Environment
This is a great local establishment in South LA near USC. It's located in a midsize food court with plenty of great vendors to choose from. The space is ran by a local non profit that caters to local businesses in the area. During the time we were there it was just getting busy. It's an active busy but not too busy space.

Service
As I mentioned earlier, there are a few food stalls to choose from throughout the food court. Once I landed on Holbox, you go up to the counter order your food they give you a number that you can take to your table and they will bring you your food. Holbox is a popular spot for lunch so the line got long pretty quickly but moved fairly fast.

Food and drinks
I learned that Chichen, another food stall and Holbox are ran by the same family - the father runs Holbox and the son runs Chichon. I ordered a fish taco because i had to try something from this famed Michelin star locale and it did not disappoint. It was delicious! Plenty of flavor and delicious. I highly recommend. It was also cool to see that they heat up the tortilla over hot coal! I will definitely go back.

I've been here twice now, first time alone and second with a couple of friends and both times were great experiences. It's located in the new food hall Mercado Paloma, which has a pretty spacious adjoining free parking lot. My first time there was about 30 minutes before opening and there were already a few people in line (you order at the counter and they bring out food to you). I took the opportunity to walk around the modestly-sized food hall to see what else was there--some intriguing options, but I was there for Holbox!

I decided on:
Uni and scallop ceviche (pricey, but worth it--so fresh!)
Grilled fish taco (my second favorite item--perfectly grilled fish)
Baja fish taco (very good, but one really shouldn't get a fried item at a place like this, where you've come to enjoy the fresh seafood. Lesson learned)

I decided to sit at the bar, and got to see the wonderful variety of hot sauces they have. I tried a dab of each one, and I can't remember which was my favorite, but they all had something to recommend them. Sitting at the bar, i also got a good look at their refrigerated cases, where huge sides of fish were hanging--impressive.

I enjoyed my first visit so much that when a couple of friends expressed interest in going I jumped at the chance to return. This time around I knew I wanted to try their scallop aguachille, after seeing another diner order it. A sizable mound of fresh scallops topped with an avocado rosette, bathing in a pool of spicy aguachille, yum. I got the grilled fish taco to accompany it, and it was the perfect lunch. My friends and I sat at one of the communal dining tables and had a great time.

I had to get the Live Sea Urchin and Scallops. Although it was a whopping $27, the sea urchin needles were literally still moving as I scooped the meat out! The scallops tasted equally as fresh and the salsa that was mixed in was the perfect balance.

Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta ($7) - omggg that was the softest octopus I sunk my teeth into! I was expecting to struggle with it a little and wonder how I was going to take proper bites of the taco, but each bite was delectable with calamari ink sofrito.

Tostada de Lenguado ($9) - the wild caught local halibut was also very fresh and I loved the kick from the habanero and aceite verde.

My friend got the Taco de Pescado al Carbon ($8) and Tostada de Jurel ($9). Unfortunately, she found a long piece of hair mixed in the tostada, so that was a buzzkill. She was a good sport about it though and ate everything anyway! Despite that, she thought they were both delicious.

It is in a food court type of place that reminded me of Grand Central Market, but with more Latino/a food!

AMBIENCE: Lots of people enjoying different dishes from the multiple restaurants in the food court. Counter service with bringing a number to the table, so it's more casual than the fancy food pics would suggest! Didn't take long to find a table either.

FOOD: Wow, I was not expecting the classiness of the dish and the delicious flavors!!! I could totally see this being in a restaurant with fancy mood lighting, but instead it is in this unassuming location filled with authenticity and culture!

We ordered the ceviche mixto, smoked kanpachi taco (hard shell), taco de pulpo en su tinta (soft taco). I must say the flavor in all of them was delicious. You could tell the fish was so fresh and the love they had for the quality of the food and the presentation was just incredible. I can't wait to go back to try more.",5 star rating

In fact, looks like this Seafood Restaurant is the most hyped as well as the most popular restaurant among all other restaurants at Mercado La Paloma food court. We came to this place yesterday on our way back to home from LA. The inside of this place is more like a food court area like Haven City Market, Victoria Gardens Food Hall etc. and they have plenty of seating arrangements. There was a long queue in front of this place and it took us a while to order food. We ordered Taco De Pulpo En Su Tinta, Taco De Pescado Al Carbon, Baja Fish Taco, Baja Shrimp Taco, Scallop Taco, and Mexican Coke. Their fish tacos were simply too good to explain!

Upgrades to the entire foodhall have been made making it very ADA & stroller friendly.

When you enter, Holbox is the first eatery you encounter. Everything is essentially cafeteria style unless you sit at the ""bar"", which is really fun. You get to see the fish they are getting ready to cut for you and even see the product in the tank as you get your first wave of orders.

If you have never had Yucatan style seafood, but love semi-raw seafood, this is for you.

They have plenty of cooked or fried fish tacos if that is what you prefer. They are of the same caliber.

I always get the kanpachi collars with rice & beans cuz it rounds out the meal with all the various mariscos my party will order depending on the visit.

Always a hit; forever recommend!

I don't know what to say, except be prepared to also be blown away. There is nothing else like this that I have come across in this dear city. The freshest seafood, very ample and generous portions, the creativity and flavors beyond, and in a food court in DTLA with extremely reasonable prices. WHAT??? You have to see it (and eat it) to believe it.

All of the dishes we tried we amazing. The only regret is that we couldn't try more because they all looked equally outstanding. Order (when you can finally choose) at the counter, and then find a seat among the many in the clean food court, surrounded by other latin restaurants. The overall feeling is of being in a latin mercado (hence the name Mercado Paloma). The food is brought to you by friendly staff and all you have to do is marvel and ENJOY!

Ceviche mixto was the best ceviche we have ever had and the portion was huge. Came with 2 tostadas to scoop with. The tuna tostada was my favorite dish - luscious, almost magical (sorry!). The sea urchin was almost too beautiful to eat, but we did anyway and it did not disappoint. And the baja taco was crunchy and delicious on the warm, homemade blue corn tortilla. This was really almost too much food for 2, but we braved our way through it.

Amazingly fresh seafood. I'm a sucker for scallops and Holbox does not disappoint. Their tacos are freaking delicious, fresh ingredients, a combination of flavors, and handmade tortillas to top it off.

The ceviches and tostados are also bomb. Honestly, you can't go wrong with ANYTHING here. Scallops. Smoked halibut. Octopus. Shrimp. Aguachile. Lobster.

My favorite part is their sauces. Like whaaaa? They have I think 6 different salsas, and each of them are amazing. Each differs by spice level, but are all labeled really well, I highly recommend trying all of them.

There's a parking lot and lots of seating. It's like a food hall so there are other things here to try as well.

1415,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Conveniently located near USC campus, this place has received multiple awards that are well deserved - Michelin guide, best restaurant in LA, etc. We went here on a Friday for lunch around noon and we were able to get seated immediately at the bar seating. There, we got the lunch special ($18) which is a ""small"" ceviche mixto with 2 Baja fish tacos. We also got the octopus (taco de pulpo en su tinta), scallop taco, and smoked kanpachi taco. All of the food is amazing!

The ceviche mixto is actually a loooot of seafood even though they designated the dish as small. It came with 1 piece of tostada which supplements the dish. It is nicely tangy with very fresh octopus, shrimp, and fish.

The Baja fish taco is an above average fish taco with the usual fixings. They use baby tomato as well on top. I wouldn't get one standalone because the other tacos we got were way better, but it was good that the 2 fish tacos were $9 which means it's almost half the price of other tacos that run $6-8.

The taco de pulpo en su tinta (octopus taco) has a flavorful squid ink base that enhances the fresh octopus leg. It also has baby tomato.

The scallop taco is also good but on the pricier end for what it is. I do love the caramelized onions that go along with it.

The smoked kanpachi taco is probably my favorite one. The dish is fairly addicting as the chili oil, although a bit spicy, is so flavorful and pairs well with the smoked fish. It's plated separately because of the chili oil. It was so good but I was too full as this is my last taco.

Portions wise, I think 3 tacos is enough for me to be full. We just order a lot more for a heavier meal, and even then, it came out to under $35 per person total which is solid for the high quality food that we really enjoyed.",5 star rating

Parking/Wait: There is a pretty big parking lot in the back. Order over the counter with about a 10 minute wait for the food to come out.

Food/Drinks: Extremely fresh seafood! Ordered their classic sea urchin & scallop ceviche along with some octopus tacos. Sea urchin spines were still moving, so you know it was recently slaughtered. Nice char on the octopus coupled with some carmelized onions on a warm house made tortilla. They also serve a little bag of chips and salsa for each person. Also some different salsas at the front counter that you could use.

Ambiance/Service: Bustling food court that was recently renovated. Plenty of tables so you could definitely bring a big group.

Ceviche the pescado: delicious. It was the perfect amount of sour where it didn't overpower the fish dish. The only concern about the fish is you have to eat it as soon as it hits the table. The longer it sits, the more sour the dish gets. 8.5/10

Oysters: can't go wrong with oysters. 8/10

Baja fish taco: hands down the best fish taco I've ever had. I'm perfect crispy crunch in every bite and the fish inside was perfect soft and seasoned. 9.5/10

Live urchin and scallop ceviche: first off the presentation was beautiful I almost didn't want to eat it. Urchin was great and soft but not too much of that umami flavor I wanted but that's just a per batch basis. The scallop was amazing as well. Melted in my mouth. 8.7/10",5 star rating

Smoked Kanpachi - a great tasty hard shell taco that has a very flavorful fish and toppings. Would recommend.

Even more pleasantly surprise to see that they are even honored on the Michelin guide.

You order at the counter and they give you a number. Then you seat yourself and they bring you your food. Water and hot sauce are self serve by the cashier. This was the order in which they brought out the food.

Chip and Salsa (complimentary) - They brought out two small bags of chips with salsa. It was a kind touch but about average. Doesn't effect the review negatively or anything since it was complimentary to begin with.

Tostada de Corvina ($9) - Wild caught local white seabass ceviche, sliced avocado, fresh habanero, aceite verde. Surprisingly liked this one more between the two ceviche we ordered. It was well balanced and pretty good. I also thought there was a generous amount of topping on the tostada.

Tostada de Atun ($12) - Blue fin tuna ceviche with avocado puree and arbol peanut sauce. The blue fin looked really high quality but the acidity overpowered the blue fin.

Erizo ($25) - The item that lured me here and the highlight of the experience. fresh live sea urchin and scallop ceviche with avocado puree and served with saltine crackers. Interesting combination. The sea urchin and scallop tasted super fresh. I was intrigued it was served with the saltine crackers but the saltiness went along with the sweet and creaminess of the seafood. Highly recommended.

Oysters ($20/half dozen) - The oysters they had were Shigokus. Decently fresh, but a few shell bits in the oysters. I think I'll stick to my usual oyster bar for oysters.

Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta ($7) - Braised and fried gulf of Mexico octopus with calamari ink sofrito. The octopus was well cooked, it wasn't too chewy or anything but the flavors were really one note and the texture was just soft. A bit underwhelming.

It was nice to finally try Holbox but this was a pricey experience considering it wasn't that much food and I wasn't in love with the food. The only item I would reorder is the Erizo if I happened to already be in the area.",4 star rating

We are not familiar with the area and it was our first time at the Mercado but I didn't need to walk around to look for lunch option, I just wanted seafood! I went here without knowing how popular and famous this place is! I was so hungry and didn't do my usual research lol. I originally wanted ceviche and also shrimp cocktail and then I saw their tacos! If I didn't have to go back to meetings I think I would've ordered more! Oh well next time! I got 3 tacos, fish shrimp and octopus. My coworker also got the kanpachi. The tacos were bomb!!! It was so good and they make everything fresh here!! We saw they have tons of corn kernel so they also make their corn flour for the tortillas from scratch! So yum!!! I would definitely come back here. One thing though, if you're on a crunch for time, you might wanna come back another time. Each order took about 25-30 minutes. Parking is also very bad. They have their own small parking lot and you can also park at the behind lot (DMV) or street but during popular time you might find yourself doing rounds.",4 star rating

The variety of tacos and innovative plates offered here introduced me to flavors I had never tasted before. Meeting the owner, Gilberto, was a highlight - I even had the privilege of interviewing him for my YouTube channel, Tesoro's Ocultos.

What sets this place apart is its remarkable achievement of securing 3 consecutive Michelin stars over the years. The commitment to culinary excellence truly shines through. A must-try is the erizo, a dish that left a lasting impression on my palate.

I can't express enough gratitude to Gilberto for his warmth and making my visit memorable. Holbox Los Angeles is more than just a restaurant; it's an extraordinary culinary journey that I highly recommend to all food enthusiasts.",5 star rating

The Aguachiles were pretty good, I've never had shrimp head because I get weird but trying them here made me a fan! The only thing is id let the shrimp sit a little longer in the juice so it would absorb it better. We had a half dozen oysters too- big fan! They serve them with this cilantro lime type sauce, my first time having it with that. DELECTABLE, someone give the chef a raise for putting his foot in all this lol.

Smoked Kanpachi Taco: the fish in this is unrecognizable. Worst taco on the menu. No one in my family ate the whole taco if they ordered it.

Baja Fish Taco: crispy tasty and flavorful and was my personal favorite!

Baja Shrimp Taco: similar to the fish taco but with shrimp and it was good!

Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta: if you like squid alot you will like this taco.

Scallop Taco: i love scallops and they were cooked to perfection however it was definitely missing something

Taco de Pescado al carbon: was just average nothing too special about it.

Overall the tacos were decent. Idk if I could say the ones we were served were michelin star worthy especially since Ive had tastier tacos elsewhere however the price is absolutely worth what you are paying for. If you were to order 3 tacos i would get the baja fish or shrimp taco, taco de pulpo en su tinta, and the scallop taco.

We also got a side of guacamole and Ceviche Mixto
which were so fresh and delicious! The ceviche was the best part of the meal and was great for sharing.

1452,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Best seafood tacos I've ever had. Hands down. For real. You wouldn't expect this type of quality food from a non traditional restaurant (it's more like a food stand really), but this is exceptional cuisine at a very reasonable price.

Holbox is only blocks away from the LA Colloseum. Got here on a Saturday night just before USC kicked off, so traffic was bad. But once you get here, there's ample, dedicated free parking, and some spots out in front. The building itself is new, clean, and has lots of indoor seating, and a few seats outdoor. It shares the large facility with a few other eateries (including one right across from it that has aguas frescas). Very casual, chill atmosphere.

As anticipated for a Saturday night, the line was a bit long, but once you pay for your food, you get a number and they bring the food out to you. It's a nice, convenient system that's hassle free. Got a small bag of free tortilla chips with some salsa that was pretty mild while we waited.

Food came out pretty quickly. Ordered the following from its extensive menu:

Scallop taco - 10/10: Large, fresh tasting scallops that came in what tasted like a roasted tomato sauce that gave it a smoked velvety finish. Man, so good.

Shrimp taco - 9/10: Large shrimps with a crisp, light breading. Loved the crema sauce. Just another winner.

Fish taco - 9/10: Probably the best fish taco I've ever had. Again, the breading was crisp, light and you could really taste the freshness of the rockfish. My only wish is that they put just a tad bit more of the crema. Otherwise, this was pretty much perfection.

Side note: the tortillas are all fresh and hand-made. Superior quality.

Ceviche Mixto - 8/10: Very fresh, very flavorful. Large portion, too. Could be shared between 3-4 people.

With all this quality and freshness, you would expect a large bill at the end of the night. Not so, at all. The prices here are super reasonable and more than worth it. Could probably charge a lot more, but please don't! Everyone should be able to eat here.

Will definitely be coming back for the other offerings. This is a Michelin Guide rated restaurant at value prices. Don't walk, but run here people.",5 star rating

1456,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Holbox is on Grand Avenue a couple blocks from Exposition Park. Holbox is the sister restaurant of Chichen Itza at Mercado La Paloma. Holbox is also an island off the Yucatan coast near Cancun. Holbox definitely serves incredible mariscos (seafood) inspired by Yucatecan cuisine and is exploring fascinating new paths.

This review is the result of a couple of visits in less than one week. I'm going to keep returning because I want what is on everyone else's plate.

Scallop Aguachile: About two dozen little raw scallops are at the center of a chilled liquid of lime juice, cilantro, serrano chili peppers, and onions. The chilies have been mashed into the water to create a bright, magical elixir. The aguachile is refreshing, electric, and super tart. The Baja bay scallops are plump and tender and perfectly seasoned from the aguachile. The avocado rose in the middle is a creamy counterbalance to all that tanginess.

Smoked Kanpachi Taco: This is a classy taco. I don't think I've ever eaten a taco with a knife before. You need it to cut through the crispy blue corn tortilla. The half-moon taco is resting on its side topped with a salsa cruda and some avocado. The taco is filled with rich kanpachi fish, which has been smoked and combined with soft gooey queso Chihuahua. The salsa macha drizzled over the taco is so delicious. It is a mix of dried chilies, garlic, peanuts, and oil.

Kanpachi Collar: The collar is a delicacy shaped like a fin of a surfboard with meat that easily separates from the clavicle. Kanpachi, or amberjack, has a slightly sweet, rich, and almost buttery flavor. The grilled flesh is smoky, charred, and salty. It's hard not to scrape every succulent and juicy morsel off the curving collar bone. The collars are served with cilantro rice and beans, corn tortillas, cherry tomatoes, and red cabbage. Squeeze the grilled lemon for a flavor boost.

I can't help geeking out over the spectacular flight of hot sauces. The ""Kut"" habanero sauce contains roasted habaneros, garlic, vinegar, and olive oil. The yellowish sauce is the spiciest one, but it's buttery, creamy, and all-around delicious.

Ordering: Order at the counter. Grab a number, and the smiling staff will bring the food to you quickly.

Dining: There are some spots by the bright counter and many tables within the Mercado. If you like, there are some seats outside in the parking lot.

Parking: The Mercado La Paloma has a nice lot with plenty of spaces. There's also street parking.",5 star rating

1459,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"I came to Holbox with my mom for lunch on a Thursday around 1pm. I had heard very good things about this place and, as a big fan of seafood, I was eager to try it. There is a relatively large parking lot in the back which was free (a blessing in LA), and was pretty busy at this time of the day but we found a parking spot within 5 minutes. Holbox is located inside a food hall style establishment which has plenty of tables, bathrooms, and different restaurants. The place was very clean, lively, and spacious! There was only a short line of around 3 people and then we ordered at the counter where a very nice gentleman took our order and gave us some recommendations which were helpful. He gave us each a bag of complimentary chips which were perfectly crispy and salted without being too oily and this delicious tangy salsa that had hints of vinegar and went very well with the chips. For food we tried:

Scallop Taco: probably my favorite taco of the ones I tried. The tortilla quality was divine and I could tell it was freshly made. The balance of flavors was amazing--the taco had this delicious salsa that was citrusy and acidic from the tomatoes and lemon, balanced out by the sweet, juicy butteriness of perfectly grilled scallops. They added so much scallop to my taco, it almost felt unreal. Very generous portion. Would recommend!

Taco de Pescado al Carbón: this was a more standard taco which had grilled fish that was very tender and well seasoned, and a delicious avocado puree which was a perfect base for everything. I only tried a bite of this but it was very solid and the taco was pretty massive! This one did not feel too mind blowing but was a good execution of a more common dish.

Smoked Kanpachi Taco: very interesting! It reminded me a bit of quesabirria since it had that signature crispy fried tortilla filled with a seasoned fish and cheese. The fish was very flavorful but not too powerfully smoked which was just perfect to balance out with the spicy and creamy elements of the taco. Had a delicious salsa cruda with raw onions which just added a little fresh kick to this. Probably my second favorite!

Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta: they do not skimp on octopus portions here! I loved seeing the perfectly grilled tentacle on my warm tortilla. I personally was a little underwhelmed by this and felt like the flavors were a little flatter even though the octopus was truly grilled to perfection (the thinnest part of the tentacle was even crispy!). I realize now that they had a salsa bar near the cashier and I wish I had added some of their salsas to this since it needed a little bit of an extra kick. The tinta, or ink, did not have much flavor so don't be intimidated by it! It just added a little bit of a creamy/ oily texture.

Grilled Octopus: very good! This entree comes with a generously sized octopus that is the best grilled octopus in terms of texture that I've had in the US. It was slightly under seasoned alone for my taste but with the lemon and almond pipian sauce (smoky, nutty, and a little sweet/spicy) was very good. Also came with a very good side salad of tomatoes and onion which seemed like pico de gallo, as well as tortilla, cilantro rice, and beans. Very filling and delicious!

Kanpachi and Uni Tostada: this is the last thing we tried and it was super good. I would say this was another one of my favorites. The base tortilla was perfectly crispy and felt so fresh, it was well salted. Over it came a generous layer of Kanpachi that was tender and had a lemony marinade which complimented the corn really well. There were little hints of spicy sauce and then the bites which came with uni were perfectly balanced by the sweet sea flavor of the urchin. I would come back for this alone! Also super aesthetic which I really appreciated.

Overall, I had a great experience at Holbox. The food was very different from the traditional seafood I've had and I think they did some dishes very well, particularly the scallop taco and the Kanpachi and uni tostada. The octopus dishes were good but, for how much hype the place has, I would say it did not fully meet my expectations even though they are still certainly better than any average octopus you will have in LA. I liked the location in a food hall, it makes it feel more open, spacious, and gives it a little market ambiance which I thought went well with the time of the day (lunch time), plus it made it seem more casual. The price tag can be a bit hefty but this truly is very high quality and I think it's worth trying at least once! They are also very generous with the amount of seafood in each dish. Would recommend!",4 star rating

The octopus was unique & perfectly chewy. The Kanpachi was so fresh. Hard to pick a favorite.

Why not 5 stars? One delivering server was not happy. The other one was friendly. We sat outside, & to my surprise, there were only 4 small tables plus a few benches.

Live Urchin & Scallop Ceviche Live Santa Barbara sea urchin and baja bay scallop ceviche ($25) - Fresh on both parts, (and yes eaten chilled). The ceviche on the bottom meshed well with the scallop and the uni was just a great topping to it.

Ordered guac which came with some crackers on it but then they brought a bag of chips after later lol. The guac was fresh and delish as a good side (or you could mix it with some of your tacos if you do so wish)

Baja Fish Taco - Crispy battered local rockfish, crema, mayo, salsa roja, pico de gallo
Scallop Taco- Pan seared Maine diver scallop, chile x'catic sauce, caramelized onions, tomato & marinated fennel

I really enjoyed the baja fish taco as it was battered well. It's a thicker piece and I did really enjoy the fact it was so. The scallop taco was seared nicely and had a rich oil flavor oozing out of it haha.

I am not usually an octopus fan, but the Taco De Pulpo En Su Tinta was hands down the best dish overall, and the best preparation of pulpo I've ever had. It was tender and juicy, with a crisp exterior; none of that overly chewy nonsense. The Baja Shrimp Tacos were a close lsecond. The Coctel de Camaron was packed with shrimp, and had ketchup already mixed in. Delicious.

Unfortunately, the tostadas were really bad (and $40 for the two). The Kanpachi & Uni Tostada was over salted, and topped with tiny, watery pieces of uni.

All the tacos here were delicious, my favorite are the Baja Shrimp, Scallop, and Octopus! However I think the Tostada were on another level! I love how crunchy and crispy the tostadas were, it paired so well with the citrusy seafoods! Definitely try them out.

Service is quick and easy. Ordered at the counter, took a number, and they brought out the foods! Parking in this area can be tricky, on the street or in the lot.",4 star rating

I love their generous portions of ceviche and it's fresh taste. Their salsas cater to everyone from the weak to the strong. It can get a line but it is worth the wait.

Came around 2 PM and there was no line. Once we ordered, we sat down in the food hall with our number and each of us got a bag of chips (complimentary). My party of three got:
- Scallop Aguachile: the scallops were so soft and pillowy. The aguachile packed a slight punch, but wasn't uncomfortable. Loved all the avocado that was given. I suggest also saving some of the chips they give prior to any food coming out so you can continue to savor the dish.
- Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta: I honestly didn't know what to expect from the octopus. My previous experience with octopi have been rubbery and bland. My mind was blown with this taco -- it was far from being rubbery. The braised octopus was so flavorful and tender that my opinion of octopus was forever changed.
- Baja Fish Taco: I thought this was more batter than fish and was mostly air than anything, but still decent. The fish is still tasty, but this was probably my least favorite of everything we tried.
- Pescado a las Brasas: whole grilled branzino. The presentation, the dish -- everything about it was magnificent. The rice held its own and was not mushy, the fish was beautiful and flaky. We devoured this even without using the tortillas.

I would love to come back and try more of their menu. Even around 2, there was still a line that formed and I can see why. There is so much care for each of the dishes and it is palpable.",5 star rating
1480,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"The seafood here is so fresh and way better than any I had at Japanese restaurants in LA. I'm shocked at the quality for such a great price! This place is a hidden gem

Holbox is a vendor located in a community food hall. Most of the tables are concentrated at the front with a few tables scattered throughout the place. After you order, they give you a number that you put on your table so they know where to bring out the food to. There is a sauce bar at the back of the left side counter of the cashier but we didn't see it until we went back to ask for to-go boxes.

The order also came with a side of fresh chips and salsa. We were too full to eat them so we took them home. Four bags barely fit one large to-go box but it was worth it. The chips were really good but the salsa was lacking flavor.

Scallop Taco ($8): This was underwhelming. I thought the cooked scallop was lacking a bit of flavor. The scallop ceviche was actually better

Baja Fish Taco ($5): The fish was fried to perfection and had a nice crunch to it.

Smoked Kanpachi Tostada ($8): This was full of Kanpachi, shrimp, and scallop so I don't know how it can be the same price as the scallop taco. This was phenomenal, even for a non-seafood gal like me. The tostada adds a nice crunchy texture and is way better than the handmade tortilla used for the tacos. Highly recommend!

Tostada de Atun ($12): The blue fin tuna was too fresh for me but didn't have any smell. I'm not a fan of the slimy texture so I only ate one piece.

Erizo / Sea Urchin ($25): This is a sea urchin & scallop ceviche. They gave some saltine crackers which I'm guessing you put the uni or scallop on top but we just ate the seafood by itself. I'm usually not a fan of uni but this was really good & fresh. Both the uni and scallop had no fishy/seafood smell or taste. I was really shocked & would actually recommend this.

Ostiones Oysters (3 for $11): I didn't try any but my husband said they were average and the least memorable of everything we ate.",5 star rating

Honestly say it's one of the few times I've been wowed at a dinner in LA in recent memory, regardless of price (of which this was incredibly fair at 115pp)

Every dish was a hit with the standouts being the tostada raspada (much different than your typical tostada; scraped while forming the tortilla giving it a thin crispy, craggy texture) and prawn aguachile (just the perfect amount of spice + the lightly fried prawn head) for me.

The set menu consisted of:
- Oyster and Geoduck
- Ceviche topped with Uni
- Aguachile with a spot prawn (!!)
- Bluefin tuna tostada raspada (!!!)
- A seared scallop with roasted poblano
- Crab and yellowtail taco served with a crab butter salsa macha

They were remodeling their kitchen, so they were operating out of their food truck parked in front. The menu was limited to ceviches and tacos for a few weeks, but they had a special of ceviche mixto with shrimp, octopus, and fish served with a crisp fried tortilla, along with 2 fried baja rockfish tacos for only $19.

Every bite of the ceviche was perfectly marinated with lime, onions, and topped with avocado and micro cilantro. The generous serving was more than enough for one person, so I saved some to take home and concentrated on the lightly battered fried rockfish tacos served with cabbage slaw, tomatoes, and a drizzle of crema and lime on excellent corn tortillas.

Since I had several visits to the area, I got different tacos on different visits, like the scallops ($8 each), octopus ($7 each), and shrimp ($6 each). Each one was either lightly seared or fried and all served with the same hearty corn tortillas.

When they finally reopened inside Mercado La Paloma with a large new kitchen and seating area, I immediately ordered the whole branzino for $28 with cilantro rice, black beans, x'catic sauce, avocado, tomato salsa, and corn tortillas.

1490,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"tl;dr expect fresh, stellar seafood tacos from this Mercado la Paloma vendor

Holbox, named for an island off Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula, is the seafood-forward venture from the mind of acclaimed contemporary Mexican chef Gilberto Cetina Jr. This taqueria sits at the chic end of the fast-casual spectrum, serving up street-style tacos with premium seafood and sophisticated techniques. Now, Holbox cooks up among the most popular tacos in LA.

Like its sister restaurant Chichen Itza, Holbox is located within Mercado la Paloma, itself a bustling South Figeroa Corridor warehouse-turned-marketplace devoted to local shops and restaurants. The Mercado's concrete floors are tastefully polished, and the HVAC is left exposed. Holbox's indoor stall is currently undergoing renovations, but the team continues to operate out of a whitewashed food truck out on Grand and deliver ""dine-in"" orders inside. That being said, the laminate wooden indoor tables are few and far between, and wrestling for a seat can feel like a contact sport; you might have better luck with the handful of additional Talavera tiled tables and folding chairs arranged on the sidewalk outside.

Already in the neighborhood, I swung by Holbox for a light bite: a single Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta. Despite the mass of folks gathered around the truck, I was able to place my order immediately. Around me, fellow diners raved about their ceviches and tacos. My quoted 10-minute wait was closer to 20, but the staff ran around preparing and delivering orders during that entire time.

Once armed with my taco and a sliver of indoor counter space, I ravenously dug in. The taco was moderately sized; larger than a classic street taco, but smaller than Taco Bell. The single octopus tentacle was grilled until crispy, then placed above a rich and briny schmear of squid ink sofrito. While the proportion of octopus varied throughout the taco, the sofrito was delicious and dynamic enough to enjoy even sans seafood. Among the accouterments, the corn tortilla was cold, chewy, and forgettable, while the side salsas were as flavorful as they were spicy.

The least palatable thing about the taco was the price, $7 for a small-to-moderate portion. While certainly not an everyday lunch for a hungry appetite, Holbox nonetheless has a knack for knockout seafood. I left impressed enough by my lone taco that I can't wait to return and try their other varieties, ceviches, and tostadas.",5 star rating

I'm not sure what the actual parking situation is since most of the big lot the Mercado is next to belongs to DMV, but there's a smaller one right outside the front door. Walking in, the first thing you'll probably see is the line for Holbox but it moves quick!

My favorite is the grilled kanpachi taco that comes with guac and lightly tossed cherry tomatoes. Second is probably the octopus taco with squid ink sofrito--it's just so tender! We've also tried the scallop aguachile, shrimp aguachile (not as good as the scallop), uni with scallop ceviche, and all of the other signature tacos. The least memorable one is the Baja fish taco since, aside from the tortilla, nothing really sets it apart from all the other fried fish tacos.

The seafood was as fresh as could be, sourced locally (looking at you @seastephaniefish!) and you can just taste the ocean. Come hungry, it's a lot of food and well worth the price. I'm looking forward to returning to try some of the delicious items from the daily menu.

Erizo (means hedgehog in Spanish) is the uni and scallop ceviche. I got really lucky and ordered the last one! This was delicious, but I wish there was more!! Chef served this to us and was very generous and offered options of saltiness or tostadas or both. We got both, of course! I think it's usually served with saltines.

Pulpo a las brasas is the grilled octopus entree. This was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! If you like octopus, GET THIS! if you're not sure about octopus, get the octopus taco to try it out because that is also scrumptious.

The fish was cooked perfectly and seasoned really well; it had the skin on and it was crisped. The toppings complimented the fish well and the tortilla was a delicious homemade corn tortilla--surprisingly soft. The shrimp from the entree was cooked in a flavorful garlicky sauce and extra bread was provided to sop up all that goodness. The entree came with beans and rice, though those items were nothing noteworthy. I do wish the rice and beans had a bit more pizzazz to them but that's not what you come here for.

You are paying high prices for a food hall restaurant, but the quality meets the price. You order at the counter, but they bring the food out to you and bus your table afterwards.

If you're complaining about pricing and saying there is better cheaper fish tacos in other parts of LA , blah blah.., then I will say you don't care about eating nasty cheap farm raised in Vietnam or some dirty ocean where the fish and shrimp are all feeding off each others poops, in polluted waters with modern salve labor type work ethics. we've all seen the documentaries, so yes if you want that nastiness then go eat your cheap trash seafood *barf*

However if you want premium and clean quality, with sustainability then Holbox is for you. Transparency with sourcing from their seafood, to their corn used in tortillas, to their micro garden for micro seasonings. I cannot rave enough. My family is in the produce business so understand food quality, demands and pricing. For what you are getting here at Holbox it is not expensive at all. They offer non gmo blue corn hand made tortillas in their tacos, all home made salsas, home grown micro cilantro and other spices, ethical very clean wild caught fish which they filet themselves (yes that's right they're not using old and prepackaged frozen filets you see at the stores) and you can taste the difference. Their clams truly steal the show, super unique and they are from my hometown. I Can die eating here it is like the last supper level good. I order here often and have even had them cater before . I always get large orders and they truly give the best quality and service every time.
I recently tried their fish soup and it is the most exquisite tasting soup and best I've ever had in my life.

1516,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Maybe I had expectations too high, I've had Holbox bookmarked for a long time and was worried it would be super busy because of the recent accolades the past 2 years. We left the Science Center early to get here before opening and luckily we were 3rd in line when they opened at 11:30.

Uni and Kanpachi Ceviche Tostada: Our favorite, comes topped with 4 pieces of Uni on a perfect Tostada. We loved it and the ceviche was properly drained so the tostada didn't get soggy. Just a comment on the concept, the onions and limes used to make the ceviche have a very strong taste that competes with the delicateness of the Uni.

Octopus and Scallops Tacos: Housemade tortillas were excellent on both. The squid ink sofrito with the octopus had a sweet taste that made it more like a dessert and we were in the mood for savory. Scallops tasted fine, I think I would have liked their aquachile version more. The fennel on top had a sharp flavoring that battled with the scallops.

Shigoku Raw Oysters: This was the main problem with our meal. They forgot our order and by the time we went to ask about it the line was long delaying them even more. To the staffs credit, they squeezed shucking them in between other orders and we got them fast once they realized the order never came out.

Shigoku's should have a light clean taste but ours were super briny. They didn't feel like they were cleaned and scrubbed well with cold water before shucking, it reminded me of the disappointing fresh Santa Barbara Uni we had that wasn't cleaned well and tasted super salty.",3 star rating

Near USC, it's in a little food court-like place with a few other eateries and open seating. Parking lot is a bit small but enough for maybe 20-30 cars so press your luck and try to find parking there. I came for dinner and my friend and I shared most dishes that could be shareable. For the tacos, I recommend the fish taco and the pulpo. The fish was light even though it was breaded but the mixture of textures and flavors was a great combination. The octopus was also not chewy but the hit was the veges underneath. I honestly don't know what it is but the sour flavor contrasting the lightly grilled octopus was also a great flavor combo, I'd skip the kampachi. It was just ok. The ceviche of the day was bluefin. Super fresh but also a bit one noted. I really enjoyed the filete al carbon. The fish was delicately cooked but the stars were the rice and beans. I devoured that and the fish was just a great compliment to it all. Finally the blood clams... I didn't enjoy them but I guess you are supposed to get this? I'd still recommend skipping still.

The different textures throughout the meal from the soft tortillas, light crispy battered fish, to the perfectly cooked charred octopus were very intentful and mastely done. The technique behind the food was very well done.

Service was goos too. They took a while to bring us our lemonades (which were delicious by the way) so we had to go up and ask, but other than that it was good.

I went for the tasting menu and it was nothing short of extraordinary. The menu is a harmonious blend of cold and hot dishes that showcases their unwavering focus on sourcing the finest seafood and crafting innovative. Some of my favorites (among all the amazing dishes) were the uni ceviche, crab taco, and mussels with chochoyotes.

One standout feature is Chef Gilberto, who goes the extra mile by personally explaining each dish as it arrives. This personal touch adds a layer of warmth and authenticity to the dining experience, making you feel like a cherished guest in his culinary world.

The restaurant's setting, while perhaps more of a dining hall, in no way detracts from the sheer brilliance of the food. Holbox excels in delivering a gourmet experience that transcends its physical surroundings. The fact that it has been named restaurant of the year by the LA Times speaks volumes about its exceptional offerings.",5 star rating
1527,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"I waited for months to clinch a solo spot at the 8-seat, Mexican Seafood tasting counter at Holbox. There are two seatings each, on Thursdays and Fridays only. Furthermore, Holbox was named the LA Times 2023 Restaurant of the Year. In this same year, Chef Gilberto Cetina was one of five finalists for the James Beard Best Chef California award. Holbox has also received several prized Michelin Bib Gourmand ratings.

One must be cognizant of the unique facts. Chef Cetina does not have any formal degree or training in the culinary arts. Instead, his impressive experience was first harnessed from shadowing, participating and learning from his father in the family kitchen. This on the job training was later supplemented by reading numerous cook books. Brilliance does not need schooling. In the gourmet arena, all it needs is long hours of observation, adaptation, discipline and relentless passion.

The tasting courses covered a gamut of cold and raw, hot and cooked dishes (please see my pictures, which also includes the degustation menu). I was fortunate to get the best seat in the house (I arrived 2 hours before show time). Therefore, I had a direct live view of the slicing, dicing, assembly and final preparation of each dish. All of it fresh, right before your eyes. During a pause we were treated to a snack of barnacles in garlic and butter. A first for many, if not all. This was during the 4th course, when the slated Albacore ceviche offering did not meet the Chef's mark, as prepared by his associate (too much lemon he told him). The same course was redone, and substituted with Yellow Tail.

The Holbox team delivered the dishes with finesse, elegance and perfectly orchestrated timing. All along, Chef Cetina explained each course, its ingredients and method of composition. It started with raw courses and ended with cooked dishes, langoustine taking the final bow. Keep in mind that you have to be a fan of seafood, most of it raw, to appreciate the Chef's take, derived from his days on the Yucatán peninsula. The geoduck, barnacle snack and abalone were rubbery, to the bite. Not my favorite. Portions are not skimpy, and Chef Cetina is generous to keep the tab at $115 (additional 18% gratuity and taxes are extra). The complete check has to be paid at the time of booking, weeks or months before you get there. The restaurant also has a regular menu, which is operational during opening hours. Parking in the lot at the Mercado La Paloma (home to the eatery), is limited, but free. The big challenge, is getting to the location in LA traffic, depending on your starting point. I had to battle one and a half hours of notorious stop-and-go gridlock, each way, to make it there, then calm down, relax, appreciate the vibe and make myself ready, to taste the amazing seafood flavors of Mexico.",5 star rating

Upon receiving my take-out order from the friendly counter staff, I took my meal home and enjoyed the fish tacos, tostada and smoked fish, which I've never had before.

While it's on the pricier side, it's a GREAT value for such high quality food. I eat seafood almost exclusively and this is by far my favorite ceviche. Holbox is probably one of the most consistent restaurants I've been to. I can always rely on it for the same quality dishes.

My favorite dish is the shrimp ceviche plate. It's a good amount of shrimp cooked perfectly and the tomato, cilantro are SO fresh. Also, I'm not sure how they make the tostadas but theyre like crack to me. I always have to ask for more.

While I've eaten the lobster a few times, I have to acknowledge it's not the best thing on the menu.

The shrimp cocktail is much sweeter than a normal shrimp cocktail because it's made with tamarind.

The oysters are so good and fresh, they come with an aguachile salsa on the side that is to die for.

If you are eating at Holbox, you need to go to the salsa section by the water and try all the salsas. My favorite is the peanut butter salsa which has a slight kick but mostly savory.

The fish and shrimp tacos are my second favorite thing on the menu. The tortilla is hand made and just the right texture/thickness.",5 star rating

Gilberto Cetina, Jr. is the Chef/Owner and you will more than likely see him! He's usually around, either here or at Chichen Itza where he took over as a chef from his father Gilberto Cetina Sr.

Don't be discouraged by the parking situation at Mercado la Paloma, where Holbox & other businesses are located. There's a small parking lot inside the open gates in front. If those are filled, they do open another area for free parking as well. Or, the last option would be to park at the meters on Grand Ave. Inside the Mercado, there are public restrooms.

Holbox is pronounced ""hol-bosh"". It is a tropical island located a few hours north of Cancun. No matter how you pronounce it, just try them out! I'm so happy we finally did! It had been among my bookmarks for a few years!

Lots of Instagram posts show all sorts of beautiful or kawaii foods from various places, but when you eat them, they are very lacking in taste. That is NOT the case here!!! Their plates/bowls of food are equally as flavorful as they are beautifully presented!

I have to say that I really am impressed with Holbox! They prepare their raw seafood dishes on the counters visible to the public. This is the only place where I've seen them make the ceviches on the spot. Everything we've eaten is so fresh and amazing! For having 2 Michelin Bib Gourmands, their prices aren't even that steep! Having anything to do with having a Michelin anything doesn't mean I'd like it. It just raises expectations. I was not disappointed at all!!

If you are fortunate enough to get a seat at the counter, you can order from your seat. Otherwise, you stand in line and order then take your number to the table you find and they'll bring your food to you. Even if the line is long, it doesn't seem to take very long for you to get your food!

The food here is not spicy (for me). They have 4 different Hot Sauces (Chile Morita, Arbol-Guajillo, Chile Habanero, & Kut which is Roasted Habanero-Garlic) available for you to portion out what you want into some disposable condiment containers. After you order, they bring out complimentary chips with a salsa. I recommend sampling these hot sauces with chips to see what appeals to you.

Entice me with Uni (Sea Urchin)! I had to try the Live Urchin & Scallop Ceviche ... just had to!! I've had it several times now and still love it! It's absolutely the best ceviche I've had yet! It is so fresh and decadent! If you eat only one thing here, I recommend this!!

The other dishes we've enjoyed were: Shigoku Oysters, Taco de Pulpo en Su Tinta (Octopus Taco), Baja Fish Taco, Smoked Kanpachi Taco, Kanpachi & Uni Tostada, and a Smoked Kanpachi Tostada.

The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the Pata de Mula (Blood Clams), but I tried them.

My next things to try would be the some of the entrées. I keep gravitating to the items I've already tried!

This place opened in 2017. There was a Yelp Event that I found out about too late and missed. And a few years later, here I am! Please, don't hesitate to make your way here!!

The kampachi, with its fresh and succulent flavor, was the perfect star of the show. The uni, with its delicate brininess, added a layer of richness that took the tacos to another level.

The combination of these top-quality ingredients in a taco was nothing short of genius. The flavors and textures harmonized beautifully, creating a taste sensation that I'll remember for a long time.

The presentation was equally impressive, with each taco looking like a work of art. The balance of flavors, the quality of the seafood, and the skillful preparation showcased the chef's talent.

There isn't really anything else that I can say that everyone else has not already said... from the food to the customer care to the vibes... all excellent!

To be honest, when my friend and I arrived around 1:30pm on a Friday, we were not that hungry. We had a pretty big breakfast, but everything was so good that we ate it all!

We were lucky that it was after the major lunch rush so there was no line and we walked straight to the counter to order. We got the ceviche mixto, the erizo/sea urchin, 2 smoked kanpachi tacos, 2 Baja fish tacos, 1 scallop taco, and a taco de pescado al carbon. It does take a little bit to get your food, but you get a little bag of tortilla chips and salsa to tide you over. And if there is space, try to snag a seat at their counter where you can watch the chefs prepare the ceviche and other food!

The first to come out was the ceviche which is served with a side of tostadas. Personally I am not a big fan of onions and cilantro (I know, I know...) so I passed on it. The little bit of the octopus and bass that I did nibble on was very fresh tho! My friend was a big fan of it and ate the whole thing by himself!

Shortly after the ceviche, the uni came out and it was delicious! I had the uni by itself first and it melts on your tongue (the signage said it came from Santa Barbra). Then I tried it the way it was made (with the scallop ceviche) and it was even better! Super fresh with the little bit of lime juice!

Then the rush started and all six of our tacos came out at once! We were playing some Tetris with the plates and the lady server told us that we can stack some plates on the glass panel above.

We started with the smoked kanpachi and it was probably my favorite! It was flakey and mild and I think the chili oil was really the star of the taco. I eat a lot of chili oil and this one was really good. (The spice lingers for a bit so people who don't like spicy, you might want to avoid it!) It was still very good without it, but the chili oil brings it to the next level! I worked on my scallop taco next and it needed a little bit more of their sauce, but still flavorful and fresh. The Baja taco was also super crispy and they somehow nailed the fish to sauce ratio, lol. With a little bit of lime juice, it was easily one of the best Baja fish tacos I've had in a while. My friend really enjoyed the taco de pescado, but his favorite is also the smoked kanpachi!

The food already warrant Holbox a five star rating, but it was their customer service that really propelled it above and beyond. While we were chowing down on the kanpachi tacos, Chef Cetina noticed that our other tacos were being neglected (by us) on the glass panel. He strolled over to grab them and told us that he was going to have the kitchen fire them up again so that we can enjoy them hot like intended! He also double checked to see if everything was good (it was!) and if it was delicious (it was!)! He really didn't need to, but it was such a nice gesture and it was really nice to eat a hot taco instead of a lukewarm one. The lady server (unfortunately, I didn't catch her name) was also very sweet and had such good energy! She was hustling the entire time we were there and her smile did not drop at all! The ceviche team was also on the same vibe as they were chatting and prepping and plating without pause. It was really nice to see such a happy team that really cares about the food that they put out and the service they provide!

If my epic essay was not enough to convince you to brave the LA traffic and parking, then the numerous accolades they won last year should convince you. 2023 Michelin Guide California Bib Gourmand, 2023 Los Angeles Times, Restaurant of the Year, AND #5 on the 2023 LA Times 101 Best Restaurant list. Chef Cetina was also a 2023 James Beard Finalist for Best Chef California. All of these awards were well earned and I cannot wait to see what they will accomplish in 2024!",5 star rating

After his input on Holbox I decided we eat there. Holbox specializes in various seafood inspired by the Yucatán in Mexico. There is a casual counter with seating where you can sit or you can dine at a nearby table. I ordered the ceviche de camarón and my friend ordered the Aguachiles. As we waited the kine behind us grew rather long. Someone came to take our order and seat us. The service was quick and friendly. The mercado was bustling as there were people coming from the soccer game nearby. While we waited for our food my friend shared how the establishment is family owned and operated. It is also a Michelin star awarded eatery. Our food came quickly and the presentation was artistic and impeccable. The plates were inviting and aesthetically pleasing. The ceviche was fresh with a hint of citrus; I found it refreshing. My friend's aguachiles- the tiger shrimp were delectable and the spice lingered on my tongue. I only had one bite but my friend said the heat grew weird more bites. Overall, it was a tolerable spicy. I enjoyed the food and experience.

Fresh seafood bonanza with tasty ceviches

Details:
* Ceviches are absolutely the highlight here, though the sopa de mariscos also gets a notable shoutout
* Tacos, grilled octopus, and shrimp aguachile (for the more adventurous) were less mindblowing, primarily due to textural reasons
* Tons of other seafood options in addition to the above, with a number of live seafood available as well for extra freshness
* Order at the counter inside the food court area, grab your number, and grab a seat

Was bummed that they were sold out of the Kampachi and Uni tostada so I guess I just have to go back!

I'm also a sucker for free chips and salsa. The salsa bar which includes 5 of their own house made salsas were really good paired with the ceviche.

This place is located in a food hall in downtown LA with lots of FREE parking. You can either order at the front and they'll take your food to at a table, or you can sit at the counter and order from there. There is an open kitchen with a view from the counter so I opted to sit there so I could stare at my food being made and for close access to the self serve hot sauces (which are delicious by the way). I was greeted and helped immediately by the very kind staff.

Here's what I ordered:

Baja fish taco: fish was crispy and flaky, great balance of ingredients with the cabbage, tomatoes, and crema. It was just a well executed fish taco overall. 9/10

Scallop taco: great sear on the scallops and they were super juicy and cooked perfectly. 8/10

Taco de pulpo: octopus was tender, slightly crispy at the tip. Soo flavorful! This was definitely my favorite taco. 9.5/10

Smoked kanpachi taco: this taco was fried and has Oaxaca cheese in the middle. Omg it was a complete flavor explosion when paired with the smoked fish, the salsa, and the chili oil. So good! 9.5/10

Chocolate swirl cheesecake: smooth and creamy, kinda mild in flavor for a cheesecake so the slight tang of the strawberry sauce provided nice balance. Not my favorite cheesecake I've ever had but solid and I still devoured it quickly. 8/10

Holbox, situated within Historic South Central L.A.'s Mercado La Paloma, stands out as one of just eight restaurants in the area. Named after the Mayan island of Holbox (pronounced ""hole-bosh"") off of Mexico's northern Yucatán Peninsula, it is a Mexican seafood restaurant that prides itself on utilizing fresh local ingredients, vibrant flavors, and unpretentious presentation.

The menu at Holbox showcases specialties from the coastal regions of Mexico, offering a unique perspective influenced by the bounty of Southern California and Baja California ingredients. Guests can enjoy a casual order-at-the-counter service within a lively food hall setting. Additionally, Holbox provides an elevated experience with weekly 8-course tasting menu dinners available on Thursdays and Fridays.

During my visit to LA to see my family, I couldn't miss the opportunity to try this Michelin-recognized restaurant.

Here's what I indulged in:

Ceviche de Pescado: Catch of the day fish ceviche
Ceviche de Camaron: Cooked wild-caught Mexican shrimp ceviche
Smoked Kanpachi Tostada: House-smoked kanpachi, Baja bay scallops, wild shrimp, arbol-peanut-soy sauce
Aguachile de Scallop: Baja bay scallops, lime-serrano-cilantro marinade, avocado

1563,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Came on a Sunday around 5PM with a very short 5-10 minute wait. It also wasn't too packed and we were able to get a seat for 4 people without any issues.

Overall I thought this place was good with some fresh seafood and savory tacos. But be careful the habanero hot sauce was very very spicy but then again I don't really eat spice. Below is the review of the food!

Tortilla chips and house salsa - I actually really liked their house salsa I ended up using this on all my tacos. The chips didn't taste stale or overly oily. Really good

Ceviches Mixto - this was defiantly one of the top 2 items I had here. The blend of the shrimp and sea bass mixed with their mixture was really good. Not overly salty or sour . Totally recommend

Fish Taco - this was super crispy and had a light hint of spice. The tacos came with some super large tomatoes but some how it just all mixed really well with the fish taco and spices. Recommend!

Scallop taco - thus was just okay for me. Scallops tend to have a more subtle taste and with all the sauce and spices I couldn't even taste the scallop. It was as if I wa seating a taco with no meat but the scallop was very tender.

Sopa de Mariscos - this was yummy! Came with a side of bread to drip into the soup! Think of this like a pan roast almost but less butter / creaminess. The shrimp was slightly over cooked but the fire was cooked to perfection.

Smoked Kenpachi Taco - this tasted like a very very smokey mulita taco. Personally not my favorite

Erizo Sea Urchin - I have mix feelings about this one. Let me start off by saying it was good and the uni didn't have any strong fishy taste most likely due to the amount of sauces and scallop they added to it. But that's also my issue. The uni itself almost had no flavor? If that makes sense? It wasn't sweet and when eating it I didn't even really taste like I was eating uni? Again I don't think it tastes bad I just feel like if I was eating this I would want to taste the sweetness of the uni VS it being masked by all the different sauces. Kind of like A5 Japanese wagyu you wouldn't want to drench that in A1 steak sauce.

Overall it was good but next time I come back I'll stick with just the special of two fish taco and the small Ceviches Mixto for $18.99",4 star rating

Ceviche Mixto: I had good ceviche and this compares with the fresh ceviche you get in the OG Holbox, which is and Island in the Yucatan Peninsula. Ceviche was fresh and the flavors where balanced.

The tortilla chips also deserve and honorable mention, they are light and airy, with the perfect crisp. They also have a variety of Salsas to try, I can't handle the heat but my friend liked them all.

It being where it is allowed me to have a nice leisurely experience blowing my mind at the bar in front of the chefs instead of waiting in line for hours.

By all rights there SHOULD be an hours-long line stretching from this place, which I think might have the best Mexican raw seafood in the city. I didn't try any of the plate-spanning ceviches, but I did have both the kanpachi/uni tostada and a hamachi tostada, and not only do they serve you an insane amount of raw fish that would run you twice as much at least in a sushi bar, but that fish is delicious, and topped by some perfectly complementary sauce full of flavors I couldn't pick out, other than that one was vaguely peanutty and that the aioli-looking drizzle on top of the other tasted more like a habanero-esque aji sauce than the mayo it resembled. The uni splurge was worth it - straight out of the cooler full of black spiky urchins.

The cooked octopus and sofrito taco was wild how good it was, and how well it was cooked compared to most other overcooked octopus in the area (and in the US in general). They say they braised, then fried it. Great. Let's all start doing that then. The sofrito was so black I hardly recognized it for what it was, letting the color trick me into tasting something like huitlacoche.

I've been here serveral times but never had the time and or patience to wait at Holbox, which is normally the longest line in the building. Therefore, I've always eaten some where else.

But on a late morning Wednesday, I finally did. It should be noted that prior to the Wednesday, I came here only to introduce someone to Holbox and unfortunately I was unable to order something myself. However, I did speak to one of the staff who told me the elaborate process on how they smoke the fish. The process was almost scientific.

This is the best example of the phrase quality versus quantity. There was so much freshness and flavor into these three pricey, smallish but ohhh so worth it tacos.

Sure, the restaurant is inside a non profit building and therefore you can't get a beer or margarita which would pair oh so perfectly with the food. But it can be forgiven. The tacos are simply amazing. Each ingredient seems to shine through with purpose. You can taste those Michelin stars .

And the many selections of hot sauces were also welcome enhancements. The smoked habanero, which is ferociously hot and equally flavorful was my favorite. All the staff seem as if there interning as they await to open up their own places.

I'm from San Diego, so I'm used to people saying that a place has the ""best tacos,"" so I didn't think much of it when I heard that about Hotbox. These, however, might actually be the best tacos I've ever had. The tortillas are amazing and so warm and the flavors inside are so well balanced that I didn't even feel like I needed the extra lime for brightness or hot sauce.

The amazingness of the tacos aside, the parking was also free(!). The lot is on the smaller side, so I'm guessing it sometimes fills up, but that was a pleasant surprise. The complimentary chips and salsa were great too.

I went with my boyfriend and we got one of the specials that was advertised on a sign: 2 Baja fish tacos + ceviche mixto and added 2 more tacos so we each had one of the Baja fish tacos and a different one. I did the scallop taco, and I was really surprised at the amount of scallops included--well worth the $8! I think for 2 people we probably could have each had another tacos, but we weren't really hungry... Next time, I'll definitely bring my appetite and probably just go for the tacos because while the ceviche was great, the tacos definitely stole the show.",5 star rating
1594,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"This place is the Providence of this price point. Before trying Holbox, I thought ceviche HAD to be from a small hole in the wall joint, made by an Abuela (La Cevicheria comes to mind). But this place really nails the balance between elevating classic dishes without losing its identity.

We had the 2 fish taco and ceviche combo, guacamole, scallop aquachile, and churros. The fish tacos were good, albeit a little less crispy than I personally prefer. The taste was on point though with the cherry tomatoes perfectly balancing the fried fish. The guac was awesome. Watching the chefs hand whip some fresh cut avocado into the creamy end product really enhanced the experience.

The stars of the show are definitely the ceviche and aquachile. Both were well seasoned and super citrusy. The chile water from the aquachile was refreshing and punchy while the scallops had a great bouncy texture. The mixed ceviche was equally as amazing, with a nice balance of sour from the limes, creaminess from the sauce and freshness from the tomatoes and herbs. Most impressive was how the octopus was treated. I usually dislike ordering octopus since, in my experience, I usually end up with a chewy mess. Definitely not the case at Holbox. Churros were just ok, imo. But I don't have a giant sweet tooth, so take that as you will.

Definitely a place i'd recommend to anyone who loves ceviche or seafood. And a must visit for anyone coming from outside of LA. Well done Holbox.",5 star rating

Scallop tacos (8) are delightful. You get two maybe 3 pieces of plum scallop that have subtle flavor. Eat them slowly and don't mix them with other bits since the flavors aren't as pronounced as the other items.

We came on a Tuesday evening around 7pm and it was pretty empty, no line and plenty of parking in their lot. Important to note they close at 8pm, but we had no issues finishing our meal in time.

We ordered their special, which is 2 baja fish tacos and a ceviche mixto for $18. Each taco is usually $5 and the ceviche is $20 I believe, so this was great value in my opinion! The fish tacos were perfectly crispy, not too saucey, and the fish quality was amazing (which was just the case for all of their dishes). The tacos are pillowy soft without being crumbly. The ceviche was also one of the better ceviches I've had in a while, but keep in mind it's pretty acidic, so I had to space it out throughout my meal.

In addition to the special, we ordered the octopus taco ($7) and the kanpachi collar ($17). The octopus taco was good, but probably the least memorable dish for us of the entire meal (like we could have done without it). The kanpachi collar was perfectly grilled, the meat was flakey and moist, and the accoutrements made for more hearty tacos.

We left stuffed, but didn't feel gross.

This delicious food stall is situated in the Mercado la Paloma food hall in south LA. We were not sure where to check in for our reservation when we walked in but the staffs were all very helpful and friendly. I felt the service was warm, professional and never did we felt it was a food court kinda establishment. We had everything we needed from the staff for our meal. We actually really loved the casual vibe which made the meal more fun!

We got seated at the counter right in front of the chef.
First course was geoduck sashimi with blood clam and oyster which is a perfect way to start a meal, in my opinion. It was very refreshing with a good balance of citrus and umami.

Then the uni did not disappoint. The roe in the live prawn was amazing! The scallop was grilled to perfection on its own shell. The crab butter on the crab taco was superb.
Oh my favorite was the lobster! Not that I haven't had good Maine lobster but it was flavored so well with a wonderful Smokey aroma. The fresh tortillas were delicious too.
The ingredients were super fresh!
And I loved their habanero hot sauce! Luckily they sell it by the bottle and we got two bottles to go!
The hot sauce was on the side so you can adjust the heat to your own tolerance.

The food was so well flavored with the perfect balance of Mexican flavors, we had to ordered more food! To be honest, we were in the hungry side but also felt the urge to tried more food in the menu outside the tasting dishes.

We also got the seafood stew and the wood grilled branzino. Both also amazing! The stew was so flavorful and care was taken to keep the grilled fish skin crispy on top of the stew. We ordered one order of the soup but they were nice enough to spit it into 4 bowls all with their own piece of crispy fish skin.

The branzino was cooked perfectly as well! Very moist. A great mix of sweetness from the fish with herbs inside the fish and a Smokey aroma. I was super full by the time this came but couldn't help but devour it anyways.

1645,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Holbox is easily my favorite spot for tacos. I've been here twice and ordered every taco on their menu both times. Despite this being two years apart, the quality has not wavered.

My friends went here as spot number 6 on our LA taco crawl and although I was stuffed with 10 tacos before, I still enjoyed every bite. My favorite on the menu is the Smoked Kampachi Taco, but the Pulpo en Su Tint is a close second. The octopus is cooked very well. My favorite part about Holbox is that I get the opportunity to try flavors I haven't tried before.

Aside from the tacos, I enjoy their ceviches as well. I'll definitely be back! I want to try their entrees next time.",5 star rating

The restaurant is located in a food court in South Central. It has ample parking and open seating in the food court. This area has a lot of great food but Holbox definitely stands out for its quality.

The seafood is always very fresh and tasty. The menu rotates based on what seafood is fresh and available and can change seasonally. The staff are really friendly and knowledgeable. On my first visit here, one of the items we ordered actually ran out and they offered us some complimentary items to replace that order. Also, I LOVE the complimentary chips and dip. So good but beware it is spicy!

Overall, highly recommend for the seafood lover.",5 star rating

It's located in Mercado La Paloma which is this cute international food court- with a free parking lot attached in Los Angeles... how awesome is that?

You step through the doors and Holbox is right within your view with their red Michelin signs proudly displayed behind the counter.

I got the live uni and scallop- which was soooooo fresh that the sea urchin was still moving when it came to the table. It was so buttery and delicious. The fish taco, shrimp taco and the octopus taco were all amazing. The octopus was so tender and flavorful. I recommend getting the two taco and ceviche combo because it was the best deal to try things. There is a hot sauce bar with different degrees of heat and they also bring you complimentary chips and salsa while your dishes are getting prepared. If you sit at the counter, you get to see them preparing the seafood! I didn't sit by the counter this time but I would love to do that next time.

Their seafood is top notch here. I tried their octopus taco and it was super tender (not chewy) and full of flavor. Highly recommend it. The calamari ink sofrito was a nice complement to the octopus.

I love kanpachi and for them to showcase it in their glass display made me really excited. Their kanpachi fish taco was excellent. Perfectly grilled with light flavoring and toppings so the natural awesome fish flavor of the kanpachi can shine. I would order a bunch of these in a heartbeat.

I also tried their sea scallop taco and not surprisingly, it was also very delicious, perfectly pan seared and can really taste how fresh their seafood is.

I more or less tried every single item on their menu. Their shrimp (mexican blue shrimp) was also very tasty, it was fried to perfection. Grilled would have also been a nice option.

Moving beyond their tacos, I got their kanpachi and uni toasada and that was amazing. Very fresh uni and kanpachi was nicely firm and cubed and tasted awesome. Highly recommend ordering this one. The guys running this place know what they are doing. Nothing was too sour or overseaoned, everything was just right.

Not surprised it got Michelin's attentions in a highly hole in the wall spot.

I also tried their oysters, they were Shigoku and they were nice. Clean tasting and fresh.

Overall had an amazing experience here and can't wait to come back for more. I do wish they consider opening more locations and ideally in San Diego if possible as the drive to eat here is sooo much LA traffic/driving but I would do it again in a heartbeat because of how great the food is.",5 star rating

I like the setup of the counter seats and how the open area allows you to see the magic that goes behind each dish. Seating is limited so if you get the opportunity, always sit at the counter.

I'm obsessed with the Chile Kut salsa. Just thinking about the flavor and heat of the salsa makes me drool. The oysters were shucked well and served with green and red salsas. The green salsa is the same lime/cilantro salsa from the aguachiles, which was served with lightly fried shrimp heads and an avocado rose in the center. The coctel mixto had a hearty and clean taste that almost had a sweet aftertaste. There was a good amount of bite sized seafood and diced avocados and red onions that went well with the saladitas.

I was bummed that there were sea urchins but was told I couldn't order any sea urchin dishes for the evening. Everyone knows when you see sea urchin on the menu, you have to order it!",4 star rating
1654,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"I'd been meaning to try Holbox for years when I finally got to go for a quick dinner last month. Now that I've eaten there, I'm kind of kicking myself for letting it languish in my bookmarks. I'll now be visiting as often as I can manage.

Holbox is currently #13 on the L.A. Times 101 Best Restaurants. It gets consistent notice from the Michelin guide and Chef Gilberto Cetina is a James Beard nominee. The place is about as casual as it gets, located in the Mercado la Paloma food court near USC, but the fare is totally gourmet. You can even come for a tasting menu on Thursdays and Fridays. No alcohol, unfortunately.

I went with my friend Amelia G. before an event at the Shrine. We needed to be out by like 7:15, so I appreciated the easy parking and the fast, friendly service. We ordered at the register and took our seats at the attractive white-topped counter, though you can take your food anywhere in the Mercado, or even to-go if you so desire.

We ordered a nice spread for our little party of two, and everything was beautiful and delicious. We got a small guacamole to start, and it was fresh and tasty, with good tortilla chips. Then we had a ton of seafood. The ceviche mixto was a vibrant chopped mix of Yucatan octopus, wild Mexican shrimp, Baja striped bass, and salsa vegetables. The almeja preparada was an East Coast surf clam prepared two ways, with coctel and aguachile sauces. The clam was giant, and I loved the chewy texture and both the red and green versions were excellent. The kanpachi and uni tostada was a luxurious treat, a crunchy round of tortilla topped with a good amount of kanpachi and uni, along with walnuts, salt, shallots, champagne vinegar, and pecorino romano cheese. I only got one taco this time around, but it made me want to come back and try every taco on the menu. The taco de pulpo en su tinta was gorgeous and utterly superb, with gulf of Mexico octopus braised and fried just right, along with calamari ink sofrito, cherry tomato, and delicate little stems of micro cilantro.

Holbox is a gem, worth going out of your way for even without a liquor license or a dining room. I regret waiting so long to check it out and plan to make up for lost time by going back as soon and as frequently as possible.",5 star rating
1655,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Pros: free parking (big, free lot out front), good food.

Cons: rather busy (long wait for seating, long wait for food), the semi-cafe, semi-restaurant, semi-casual, semi-formal concept is a bit of an odd experience...And there is room for improvement in terms of ambiance.

THE FOOD
The food is quite good. I read that the octopus can be fishy here, so I ordered the mixto ceviche without it. I think this was on par with Mexican seaside/beach town restaurant/cafe ceviche. The fish tacos were also some of the best I've had! My only suggestion would be adding a more refreshing salsa or sauce to the tacos (even if just as an option on the side). After eating such a refreshing and pleasantly acidic ceviche, the fish tacos just seemed like they were missing a little something. The lime wedges didn't quite bring enough acidity for me. That said, the fish was excellently fried and wonderfully tender, the flavors melded together well, and the vegetables included were fresh.

WARNING: they have a hot sauce station at the bar (4 jars of hot sauce). ALL of them except, ironically, the red one, are SPICY AF. Omg. My mouth was burning for almost 10 min after trying them. You'd think they'd come in varying degrees of hot, but no. They are all very hot. Except the red one. That one is rather mild.

LOGISTICS
It is an ""order at the counter, bring a number sign to your table"" type of place, but it also has a very small bar area (~5 seats). It's not an alcohol bar (they do not serve alcohol), it is a bar where they make the ceviche. It was actually kind of interesting to sit at the bar, but also weird, because in every other type of bar, you order with the bartender (or sushi chef), but here, you still order with a waiter/waitress. Who is barely around lol. I know the setting itself doesn't lead you to expect exceptional service, but it was confusing to navigate.

It was also weird to be standing in line (to order at the counter) for a relatively long time (10+ mins), waiting to order, only to have the bar area (~5 seats or so) open up suddenly.

Possibly organizational improvements would help?

AMBIANCE
They could benefit from a greater investment in ambiance. I would understand for a complete hole-in-the-wall restaurant (which this place kind of presents itself as, so it is sort of confusing)...but for the price of some of the dishes on the menu, it just doesn't seem to match. There are entrees approaching $30 here that just weren't things I wanted to order and eat in this setting. To be fair, I ordered the small ceviche+2 fish tacos special for $18, which was not exorbitantly priced. However, there were things that I definitely would have ordered if the environment had been more comfortable. For instance, the shrimp entree for $28 looked pretty good, but just seemed weird to eat in this setting.

It was also weird that some of the dishes were ceramic, some were plastic, and some were paper...ie, my ceviche was presented on ceramic, with some gastronomy-inspired plating, but the accompanying tostada was on a paper plate. Then, the tacos were presented on a plastic plate. The cups were plastic, and the sauce cups were plastic. Just COMMIT to something, please. I know it is not the most important thing, but it just made the whole experience rather comical.

The bathrooms are a bit unkempt...I know it's not exactly in the purview of this specific eatery in the food court(?), but it is a bit jarring to walk in to after eating at a place that serves uni and lobster on the menu. Don't bring any of your uptight friends/dates here lol.

Overall, definitely worth a visit for the food! Just know what to expect in terms of environment.",4 star rating

A Mexican seafood spot inside a renovated warehouse designed to provide affordable leasing opportunities to local businesses to set up and sell direct to the public

Holbox is a standout here and for good reason, it was recently awarded a Michelin Bib Gourmand which recognises those restaurants and food outlets offering next level food and service but at affordable prices in a casual setting

We had

Ceviche Mixto : fresh and beautifully marinated pieces of octopus, shrimp and striped bass with a big fresh tostada, delicious and generous in size it's a great share plate starter

Smoked Kanpachi taco : fish tacos with queso chihuahua, salsa crudo with avocado and peanut salsa. This was the winner for me and could have quite easily eaten more of them, great fresh fish flavours with a little zing and spice combining beautifully with the subtle smoky aroma of the salsa macha's fried chillies and peanuts and the woodsmoke from the grill , absolutely delicious

Baja fish tacos : These are amazing little bundles of taco joy, simple and not overloaded with ingredients but big on taste and flavour with a nice crunch from the batter, an all day everyday taco and as good a fish taco as I've eaten anywhere

Coktel de Camaron : wild caught shrimp cocktail , big serving of fresh plump shrimp swimming in a sweet and spicy tomato soup with big chucks of creamy avocado, and finely diced onion cucumber cilantro and celery , served up with plenty of salty crackers to dip and snack on or crumble through as you go , hard to share but stop thinking of your self type of stuff !

Second generation family owned business that is deservedly doing well

So much more to enjoy here so a return visit is definitely on the cards

The food is fresh and lovingly prepared. Every employee I've interacted with has been awesome, knowledgeable, and accommodating, qualities that stem from the man himself, Chef Gilberto.

Holbox is a clear labor of love. There is not a single thing on the menu that hasn't been tested, trialed, perfected, then perfected again. I love every single thing on that menu and wish I could go there every single day. The ceviche is always light, well balanced, playful with the acidity. The aguachile has a heat that's cut by the lime and leaves you craving more. Order something fried and be ready for a batter that elevates the seafood, without creating a greasy heaviness. If you're lucky enough to try their breads (made in house) you will find yourself wondering why they don't have a bakery on the side. Even the cheese is home made!

Go there on an ordinary day and be amazed by the food. Go there for the tasting menu and be amazed by the chef. I had one of the best meals of my life in the middle of Mercado La Paloma. Sea urchin, geoduck, box crab, and more. The food was spectacular, but learning about Chef Gilberto's passion was the most memorable part of all.

I have been a devoted fan since my first bite of that ceviche mixto. It is my mission to bring everyone I know to this restaurant so they can experience the magical touch of a chef who knows how to make the seafood shine.

The small little restaurant is called ""Holbox"" and it's located on the edge of town of USC (L.A) The food court name is La Paloma. It has a modern look to it with concrete floors and yellow walls. I was greeted by many works and was self seated near ""Holbox"" where I chose to eat. Honestly they have many other grate places to choose from.
Holbox, had a good selection of dishes, but I decided to order the Tostada de Jurel (wild yellow tail) Next time will I will try a little bit of everything!

We had:
Uni Toastado: This is what actually drew me into this restaurant. The uni was sooo fresh and delish but I feel like the ceviche mixture below and its tanginess took away from the sweetness of the uni. The toastada was also quite hard so I just ended up eating everything ontop of it with a spoon lol

Uni Ceviche: This was really good! The ceviche had lots of flavor and generous with ifllings and the amount of uni was to die for!

Scallop Taco: This was unexpected but so good! The scallop was tender and full of flavor! What a game changer

Baja Fish Taco: Flavors were good but I felt the batter and fish could have been more crispy

Octopus Taco: This was amazing too! The octopus was cooked to perfection and its accompaniments really set it apart from the rest

I loved how we were able to sit infront of the kitchen, even in a food court and watch them prep the food while we eat. Great experience and would reccomend if you're in LA!",5 star rating

Now that I have, been raving to friends and family what they have been missing and definitely worth a trip even if you live 40 miles away (in our case). It is part/inside of Mercado La Paloma which is a community hub of other restaurants and businesses - close to USC, LA Trade Tech, etc. here are some tips and info:

1. Parking - always my trepidation when coming to DTLA and surprisingly place had plenty of free parking - yes free! We had choices on space coming here on a Friday night at 6 p.m. so...off to a great start!
2. As you walk in the one story building, I noticed outdoor dining right away (another plus) and plenty of communal tables inside
3. Set up is similar to Grand Central Marker but smaller scale so there are other food choices if you or your companion(s) don't feel like eating seafood
4. Food - Heavenly
Uni and Scallop ceviche - out of this world - I am not a big fan of uni (sea urchin) but remained open minded and this tastes like butter...super creamy. I could have had a second plate to share but don't want to be a glutton :/ definitely my fave!
Smoked kanpachi tacos - soft tacos and definitely can taste the smoky flavor of Kanpachi
Pulpo Asado - great presentation and the octopus had the perfect char and delicious sauce
Filete Al Carbon - my least favorite as they could have seasoned the branzino filet a bit more but fish is perfectly cooked
Fresh oysters - very, very fresh and cucumber agauchile was perfect accompaniment
5. Service - even though we were not seated at the counter, staff got us started with a bag of chips (for each person - nice touch) and salsa. Food kept on coming that we did not feel they forgot about us which can be the case in busy restaurants and they were busy that Friday night.

I enjoyed the following with 3 people:

Mixto ceviche - fresh, very limey but good and octopus is tender

Uni and kanpachi tostada - also very strong in lime flavor, Uni was fresh and didn't come from a tray, but likely a live urchin :p

Baja Shrimp taco - 2 large shrimps, solid pick, crunchy and battered well. Same fixings as the Baja fish.

Baja fish taco - nothing memorable imo but good! Usual Baja fish taco fixings with cabbage, cream and pico de Gallo

Pulpo asado - mmmmm so tender, flavorful and came with a tomato salad, grilled lemon, avocado, rice and beans, and tortillas. Easy to make more tacos out of this dish

Scallop taco - delish! But I felt it was pricey since it was just one scallop cut in half. The grilled onions were a good compliment.

I'd recommend sticking to one ceviche or tostada item, either dish had the same lime flavor from
what I selected - so it'll be what seafood you're feeling when you visit.

They recently came in at #13 on the LA Times top 101 restaurants list which is very impressive seeing the other restaurants that share the top of the list. They also received a Michelin Bib Gourmand in 2021.

I ordered their Baja fish taco, pulpo taco and live uni and scallop ceviche. Both the tacos were phenomenal. So much flavor in them. I was especially surprised at how awesome the pulpo taco was. The octopus was cooked perfectly so you can easily bite through it.

I really wanted to like the ceviche but it's not something I would order again. You get an entire uni shell cracked in half with each half filled with the scallop ceviche and topped with the uni. The presentation was awesome and you can tell they use extremely high quality seafood with it. My complaint is that it was overly salty and acidic. So much so it really overpowered the delicate sweet brininess of the uni, which should really be the star of the dish.

Aside from my disappointment with the ceviche I definitely plan on coming back and trying more of their tacos and other dishes. I feel the prices are pretty reasonable considering the quality of seafood they use and how complex and creative their dishes are.",4 star rating

The scallop from the aguachiles literally melt in your mouth. Love eating this with the tortilla chips and the avocado drenched with each bite with a spoonful of sauce.

The oysters were pretty good too. They only had one option when we were there though. They had the fat bastards this weekend.

Lastly, tried the camarones and the pulpo taco. Both were spectacular. The pulpo taco was served with calamari ink sofrito which added a creamy texture and unique taste to it. The camarones taco comes with two huge shrimps with perfect pairings with their salsa and cabbage. Their tacos used home made corn tortillas too!

They also have a sauce bar. I tried all of them and my fave was the garlic habanero. Coming in next was the regular habanero and then one of the hot sauces that was the darkest colored one.

Holbox lives up to the hype! Holbox (pronounced hole-boj) is a restaurant that specializes in Mexican-inspired seafood cuisine. I believe they gained recognition when they received a Michelin plate (not a star).

The restaurant itself is tucked away in Mercado La Paloma, in the Figueroa Corridor. From the outside, you would expect absolutely nothing. I still can't believe Holbox is in this location.

We ordered the Oysters, Scallop Ceviche, Mixed Ceviche, Branzino, Seafood Stew, and Fish Tacos. Their portions are definitely large enough to be shared, but one friend and I (2 people) managed to finish all of this. I think the total cost for this food was around $120.

You can clearly taste the freshness and flair in each dish. I highly recommend the oysters and the ceviche. If you could only try one item from here, it has to be the ceviche. I've never had ceviche that was more vibrant or fresh than Holbox.

The Branzino and Fish Tacos are catered to people who actually want to sit down and have a real meal. But I think the authenticity of Holbox shines in their raw food.",5 star rating

Fish Tacos - 3/5 Breaded fish topped with crema, mayo and pico. Not for me, but I understand this is well-enjoyed by those who like their fish tacos breaded.

Cevice Mixto - 4/5 Overwhelmingly striped bass rather than shrimp or octopus, tasting mainly of cilantro and lime. Fresh and refreshing, but not incredible.

Pulpo Asado - 5/5 Tender mesquite-grilled octopus served over a spicy almond pipian, The perfect combination. Worth a try even (and perhaps especially) if you think you don't like octopus. This dish may well change your mind.

Scallop Aguachile - 4/5 Bay scallops in a lime-chile-cilantro sauce. Very very strong limey flavor here. Very unlike aguachile I've had elsewhere where the primary flavor was the chile. Still, scallops were fresh and delicious.",5 star rating

I had it bookmarked for months and wish I had tried it sooner. It's located inside the Mercado La Paloma (same location and owner as Chichen Itza) with a small parking lot attached.

We got the kanpachi & uni tostada, coctel mixto, scallop aguachile, and sopa de mariscos. Overall, everything was fresh and delicious, but the coctel was our favorite! We've had some great renditions of this but theirs has taken our #1 spot. The broth had a robust and refreshing tomato flavor with tons of tender octopus, scallops, shrimp, and avocado. Our next fav was the sopa de marisco, which they split into two generous portions for us. It came with thick, butter grilled toast that was perfect for dipping into the hearty soup. The aguachile and toastada were great as well but the former two knocked it out of the park for us.

smoked kanpachi tostada - so much going on in the very best way. fish was a delight and the sauces really put this one together

scallop aguachile - spicy but SO good. scallops tasted fresh and wore the aguachile sauce really well

sopa de mariscos - probably my favorite item we ordered, soup was creamy and flavorful and so so good

tacos (fish, shrimp, octopus) - all excellent, though my favorites were probably the octopus and shrimp

FOOD:

APPETIZERS ----

Oysters: Super fresh and clean! 5/5

Kanpachi & Uni Tostada: Definite must have! Love the chunks of fresh kanpachi with uni bits. You could really taste each bit of seafood without the sauces and hot sauce overwhelming the other componnets to the tostada. 5/5

Uni Scallop Ceviche: I love how it's inside of some fresh uni, but because I'm such an uni lover, I wished I tasted the uni a lot more. I know it is a ceviche, but the scallops and uni were definitely overpowered by the citrus lime taste. I wanted to love it, but I just like it. 4/5

Shrimp Aguachile: They had run out of scallop aguachile, so we decided to order this. I loved that the heads were fried! 4/5

ENTREE----

Smoked Kanpachi Tacos: My bestie's husband said he really loved his taco, and that everything meshed well with all the different and unique flavors. Apparently it was so good, he ""forgot"" to share with his wife. 5/5

Tacos de Pulpo: My husband and I both ordered octopus tacos. The octopus was cooked very well, and the calamari ink sofrito was a great addition to the taco. Probably the best octopus taco I've had - simple but tasteful. 5/5

AMBIANCE: Located inside Mercado La Paloma, which is a small indoor food court with lots of different types of food from Oaxcan food to Belizean food. We walked in and decided to go for the bar seating. There is outdoor seating available, as well.

LOCATION: Depending on what direction you're coming from, it could be hard to find since there's a bunch of trees around it. Love that parking is free - they have their own parking lot. If there isn't any parking, there is street parking available, as well.

PRICING: Compared to the other restaurants in this food hall (but being that this spot is also a Michelin Star spot), I'd say pricing can be overpriced on some items. Nonetheless, definitely would come back to try other things! $$",5 star rating

Ceviche was principally onion, and otherwise not much fish/protein was present. Limited lime as well, and other seasoning was sparse. Tacos also had little flavor, and not much ""there"" there. Very disappointing for such a well-reputed place.",1 star rating
1752,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"I've already eaten here a few times before posting this review. Holbox is located in the Mercado la Paloma, which is essentially a food court. My normal order is usually the smoked kanpachi taco and smoked kanpachi tostada. The pictures I post along with this review include the kanpachi and uni tostada, octopus taco, and scallop taco.

Starting with the smoked kanpachi taco, its not like the other tacos. The smoked kanpachi is wrapped inside the tortilla with avocado and salsa cruda on top. Biting all of that at once and you get an amazing harmony of flavor and texture. The smoked kanpachi is very flavorful and the spiciness gives a nice kick to it.

The smoked kanpachi tostada is my favorite order off the menu. Just like the smoked kanpachi taco, the flavors of the fish is strong in this one too. The addition of scallop and shrimp gives it a nice seafood taste while the tortilla provides a good crunch and stability.

The kanpachi and uni taco tostada has a strong citric-lime flavor to it. There are loads of kanpachi chunks on top of the tortilla that taste delightful. The addition of the uni gives it a stronger flavor and creamy texture. I prefer it with just a little bit less lime but it is still very delicious.

The octopus taco was nothing like I've ever previously had. The octopus itself had a very light and chewy taste but the squid ink sofrito and tomatoes gave it a sweet taste. The tortilla held the taco well and didn't get soggy.

I had a mixed opinion on the scallop tacos. The scallops themselves had a sweet and delicate taste. They were much sweeter than any regular scallop I've had before. The addition of tomatoes made it a bit too sweet for my liking though.

Overall, the food that Holbox makes is the best of the best. The seafood was fresh and amazingly prepared. The cost of the food is quite low for such high quality. Even the chips they provided stay crispy after 3 hours. This is a restaurant that I always recommend my friends to try.",5 star rating

Since it's tucked in a food hall, it means lots of seatings so even if the line got big, you wouldn't have a problem getting a table at all plus it's very casual.

We tried the ceviche mixto with 2 Baja fish tacos which was a running special ($18) they had and also got the Pulpo Asado ($22). As you wait, they give out chips and some homemade salsa. The ceviche was very fresh and the seafood was well-balanced mix of shrimp, octopus and fish. The acid was perfect and so was the salinity. Double thumbs up! The fish taco was also very delicious except that the batter could be a little reduced. The Pulpo Asado was incredible! It came with some avocado and pico de gallo, cilantro rice and black beans and the Pulpo was served over an almond pipian sauce. The Pulpo was tender and had just the right pull.

The ceviche was nice and fresh with the onions, citrus and cilantro, and it comes with one fried tortilla to scoop all of it up (meals come with a bag of chips so there was plenty more to eat the ceviche with).

The octopus taco was super nice- tender, and goes well with the sofrito mixed with squid ink. The handmade tortillas that hold everything together is perfect- not too thin, and not super thick. The most memorable taco for me though was the scallop taco- not only were the scallops nicely seared, but the sauce is what I'd come back for- buttery, tangy goodness. I seriously scraped the sauce that got on my hands with tortilla chips so I wouldn't waste it- it was that good.

Unlike the rest of the foodie world justifiably trekking from all corners of the globe to experience Holbox...we stumbled on it by accident while waiting for a concert to start nearby. We had NO idea about the celebrity status and Michelin stars until we took our first bites and started wondering what mana was causing our senses to light up. Then we saw the awards and accolades on the wall of this understated space and just nodded in agreement. The food, the experience, everything was other-worldly in the midst of what seemed like a hipster mall food court. The most beautiful part was the feeling we were eating and chatting it up with the chef in our favorite local bar. The passion for food is apparent, while the pomp and circumstance of a Michelin-starred restaurant is nonexistent.

I could go on about food specifics but am holding Holbox in deep reverence with no words to describe it. This food has to be experienced. Eat here if you're anywhere near LA/the USC campus. Even if you're not...make the trip. Get anything on the menu. The ceviche is a must. And the sea urchin. The Cheesecake. And everything else on the menu. Just order everything.

Update: In my quest to find recipes to even somewhat recreate the Holbox experience, I stumbled on

Chef Gilberto Cetina Jr of Holbox curates and prepares several kits on this site that ship fresh, complete with ingredients and prep instructions.

Have been here 3 times now, and consistency is key. First off Holbox is unassuming AF and in a food hall near USC. On top of that this spot has a parking lot.

Managed to come here all 3 times and avoided crowds to walk right up and get our orders in, so lets get to it:

Fish Tacos- Yes this is mainly a raw bar, but damn they do fish tacos good. Quite possibly the best fish tacos i've had in LA. $5 each but worth every penny.

Scallop / Spot Prawn & Scallop Aguachile - They use the freshest and sweetest bay scallops and spot prawns when they make this. The sauce itself is packed full of flavor. Definitely one of my favorite things here. get this.

smoke hamachi tostada - if you love smoked fish the smoked hamachi on this is legit. pair that up with some bay scallops and shrimp its all kinds of win here. get this.

Hamachi and Uni Tostada- Probably one of the prettiest tostadas you'll get around. Fresh hamachi paired with some SB uni and you got yourself luxury on a tostada boat into your mouth. get this.

Ceviche- Super fresh straight forward ceviche. Worth a try.

Branzino filet- This is a whole ass meal. Branzino was grilled perfectly. The beans and rice that come with it are surprisingly good too. Def give this a try.

Holbox has bar seating area that can seat about a dozen friendly people. There are some tables scattered about in the food court and there are a few more outside the front of building.

You can see the seafood they serve because it's displayed right in front of you like a sushi bar/fish market. You can def see the quality and attention they give to the food they serve.

We were lucky enough to meet Chef Gilberto when we sat down since he was chatting w/ another patron who just finished his meal.

Chef Gilberto asked what we wanted to order and since I saw the two large live Santa Barbara uni I asked for the Live Sea Urchin & Scallop Ceviche along w/ the Tacos de Pulpo. I asked if he had other recommendations and he said we should try the Camarones al Mojo de Ajo.

Everything was great! The presentation was good. You could taste the ocean in the Sea Urchin and Scallop Ceviche. Definitely a must try if you like Uni/Sea Urchin.

The tacos de pulpo were wonderfully braised and the flavorful. The Camarones de Ajo were seasoned well and didn't overwhelm the shrimp.

From the tacos de pulpo, to ceviche mixto, scallop ceviche to many others. I would say this place is a must visit for those who want the Mexican seafood experience.

Everything was fresh and the flavors meshed very well. My favorite was the octopus tacos but the scallop aguachile and blood clams were no joke. I will say the Baja fish and fish taco were great but not amazing, which isn't a bad thing at all but the things I mentioned prior are worth trying over those.

Keep in mind this stuff will be pricey relative to what you would expect of seafood and seafood tacos but the quality is immaculate.

Where do I begin? How about with the spectacular salsa they serve you as an appetizer. Perfectly tart, smoky, and fresh. I was that guy that asked for seconds and thirds for my chips, which were fresh and crispy. Seriously, they need to bottle and sell their salsa, it's that good. If I was impressed with the apps, my mind was blown by the entrees. Delicious, succulent branzino that tasted like it was caught fresh that day. Octopus that was grilled perfectly, not too chewy and not too soft. Ceviche was perfect too, not too sour and again, made with the freshest fish. It takes a lot of culinary magic to do what they do - the Michelin Star plaques that adorn their walls are well deserved. If you're coming here for the first time, you'll find this stunning place in the Mercado La Paloma. Parking is easy in the lot next to the market.

1797,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"When we first saw Holbox featured on Worth It on YouTube, I thought this was an upscale restaurant. So you can imagine our surprise when we drove up to find it located inside of a rundown and very unassuming food court style building. There are a bunch of different vendors and it's really a grab and go type of place, so I was shocked that this caliber of food (and the price point) was offered here.

We ordered ahead so we just had to pickup inside, and we enjoyed our food at their outdoor seating. It was packaged nicely and they even give complimentary chips and salsa for each person. We ordered the scallop ceviche, a taco with grilled fish and a taco with octopus. Pretty pricey for $24 but we had been eating all day so we didn't need a full menu. We were there mainly for the wood grilled fish taco that was featured on Worth It, but the octopus taco that we added on for fun ended up being our favorite. The fish taco was a bit dry and underwhelming, maybe it was just overhyped for us. But the octopus taco was flavorful and the squid ink added a unique taste. The ceviche was good but nothing too extraordinary. It tasted good with the chips, rather than the tostada shell that they provide on the side.

Overall would rate with 3 stars and I likely wouldn't go out of my way to come back or tell others to come out of their way here either. I'm giving 4 stars though for that octopus taco!",4 star rating

The prices are so low and affordable for large portions of delectable fish. The Ceviche de Pescado has a perfect texture and I shamelessly drank the leftover lime curing sauce once I ate all the fish. The pico that comes with it has a perfectly fine and crispy texture, and the extra crispy tostada tortilla that comes with it makes a great eating vessel.

The salsa that comes with the chips is incredible - it's a sweet and Smokey chipotle salsa that I could eat like a soup. They also have 4 different types of self-serve salsa that are really tasty as well.

First of all, they asked for our Covid vaccine cards. I appreciated that. Coming from the Deep South where Covid protocols were non existent, I felt honored to whip out my record on my apple wallet.

Now the food. They had an aguachile dish with a green base that left us smacking out lips and trying no to sop up the liquid in public.

I got a grilled fish platter for my kid. She couldn't fully appreciate it but that was an amazing plate for $15.

We ordered the octopus taco, ceviche mixto, scallops aguachile and the absolutely phenomenal sopa de mariscos. That sopa de mariscos was so complex and full of fresh fish, shrimp, and shellfish. It is worthy of a visit for the soup alone. I honestly haven't had seafood as fresh and delicious at restaurants with far higher price points and fancier locations than Holbox.

1808,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"I was in the Expo Park area last weekend and needed a dinner recommendation. Naturally I opened my Yelp app and @holboxlosangeles was one of the first 5 star recommendations on the list. I was a bit skeptical because of the location. But the photos and ratings really had me craving. So I decided to take a chance.
I've got to say, the location and interior vibe was just what I expected, a food court that looks like it was stuck in the 90s. Although there are outdoor seating, the area is quite messy and the tables were dirty. The streets leading into the food court were filled with trash and was quite barren.
But the FOOD was spectacular! Everything from the taste to the presentation was extraordinary! Their menu is so creative and EVERYTHING we ordered exceeded our expectations. The Uni and scallop ceviche was a showstopper. Fresh ingredients with zero fishy smell and a burst of flavor with the lime and cilantro. Then there was the fish taco and the scallop taco! (Chef's kiss) the fish was perfectly fried with no dirty oil smell and the scallop perfectly seared for a tender texture. Seasoning is also exquisite for everything. Not too salty, not too sour. Just perfectly balanced.
We'd highly recommend the shrimp aguachile and the pulpo asado. I just simply have never tasted something like it before in this combination and format.
Pricing wise, it's not cheap. on average, each person may expect to spend $25+ here. But if you take the same menu and quality to any place in the westside, it can easily be 50% to double what they charge now.
I really want to come back to taste their entire menu. Maybe the next time I'm in the area with a big group.",5 star rating

1813,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Holbox... It's one of my favorite restaurants that I could probably eat at daily and not got sick of.

Located at the Mercado de Paloma, a food hall in South Central, Holbox is the sister restaurant of Chichen Itza that serves fresh Mexican seafood.

Aside from the great flavors of the food here, I love the freshness of the seafood. Seafood itself is located refrigerated on ice at the counter to see.

My two favorite dishes here are the shrimp aguachile and pescado al carbon.
Shrimp aguachile is Mexican shrimp served raw and marinated in cilantro, lime, serrano pepper aguachile, and thin sliced swirled avocado. This dish is refreshing and the perfect amount of acidity. Served with tortilla chips and saltines. Great on a sunny day.

Pescado al carbon is a 1 pound mesquite grilled branzino served whole. Yup, with the head, tail and bones. Fish is fresh. Take a look at the fish eyes at the counter. It's not red. It's clear and freshlooking. This dish is served with flavorful saffron rice, savory black beans, pico de gallo, pickled onion, and avocado. Blend of flavors in this entre is purely satisfying. Handmade tasty tortillas served fresh add to the finishing touches for the perfect dish.

A lunch filet version is also available if you don't like staring at fish eyes or scared of choking on a fish bone.

Other great dishes here are the ceviche mixto.. Ceviche mixto consist of fresh local fish, octopus and wild shrimp in lime juice, tomatoes, onions, and cilantro served raw. Smoked kampachi tostada is also pretty good. It's served with blue baja kanpachi, scallop, shrimp ceviche, peanut sauce, toasted peanuts and avocado sauce.

Pandemic seating is outside what is part of the parking lot. The partial shade from the tree canopies help on a warm or windy day. Mercado de Paloma is currently closed for indoor dining. Hopefully, it will open up again soon so I can try their multi course dinner served indoors.

Service here is okay. The dishes take a while to prepare but the wait is worthwhile.",5 star rating

1821,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Objectively the best fish taco I have ever placed in my mouth.

The taco's flavor profile is perfectly balanced thanks to interplay between the mellow fish, the smooth crema, and the acidity from the tomatoes. Past that, I also enjoyed its textural balance as well, since the tortilla's softness was a testament to its freshness, and the fish's batter was delicate and airy while the crunch was substantial as well.

They have lots of other seafood tacos that I found to be interesting and complex but not always my cup of tea. Octopus was interesting but wasn't for me as I kept eating. Scallops were fantastic -- juicy, sweet, and paired well with tomatoes. Kanpachi (yellowtail) was a little spicy but had a very deep and smoky flavor. The kanpachi taco was formatted differently from the rest; it had a hard shell that was closed off with the kanpachi was trapped inside.",5 star rating

You order at the cashier and they give you a number. Then the start bringing out the yummies pretty quick depending on what you order. If you are not sure what to pick the cashier will make recommendations.

Everything I ordered was delicious, beautiful, and very well priced considering it's all seafood.
For sure the best thing we tried was the fish taco, easily the best fish taco I've ever had.
The scallop auga Chile was good and I can totally respect it but I think I just really live a hard sear on scallops and these are just cooked from the acid of the sauce I believe.
I did also have the branding and although it was pretty good I did think it was a little small.

Really what made this place so remarkable/memorable was how fresh everything is.
Like really, the freshest seafood I've ever had.
So although not everything was exactly to my specific preference, I still really enjoyed everything and was happy to experience dishes in a way that I hadn't previously tried.

Another thing that I really loved, is the atmosphere. You really don't have to dress up at all to eat here.
I had the most beautiful meal I've ever eaten in a parking lot and I found it really refreshing to have such a nice meal but not have to deal with all of the annoying parts of going to a ""fancy"" restaurant.

I love tacos and seafood so if you're in the mood for those - head down to Holbox! Located in a Mexican food-court style building, this is a casual spot for an upscale meal. There is ample parking in the lot connected to the building which makes it easy to go to.

My friends and I came for the tacos but also tried their Camaron (shrimp) ceviche and the kampachi and uni tostada. Along with that, I ordered the scallop ($8) and octopus tacos ($7)- each order comes with one taco and is a bit pricier for the more premium seafoods.

You pay at the counter and take a number and they will bring the food to you. The ceviche came first, followed by our tacos. Ceviche was light and refreshing. I loved the uni and kampachi toastada and it was topped with a generous portion of ceviche and uni. The scallop taco was perfectly cooked but the real winner in my mind was the octopus! It came with a tender octopus leg. I believe it is worth every penny! I love how each taco dish is different - they top it with sauces and veggies that match the protein. All of my friends really enjoyed their meal! Also, the server gave us each a bag of chips and salsa which was a little too much for us but the gesture was really nice!

This was back in sophomore year of college at USC, and I heard that Holbox was close by. I really enjoyed the Baja Fish tacos as they were fresh and very crispy. I think that the creaminess of the mayo really complimented the crispness of the fish. The portions of each taco are not too big as it is meant to be a bit more expensive. The highlight of the meal for me was the Ceviche Mixto. The freshness of the octopus/shrimp on the tortilla were an amazing combo as the crunchy bite of the tortilla contrasted the chewiness of the octopus/shrimp very well!
100% recommend the Ceviche Mixto!",4 star rating

Holbox was recently, 2023, named best restaurant in LA. The food is probably what food critics call new Mexican. It has some familiar items, like tacos and ceviche, but also more than half the menu is based on raw, fresh seafood. It is definitely beautiful and appetizing to the eye. In terms of taste, it is good. It is life changing, it wasn't for me but if you aren't looking for traditional and love sushi, this is a great option. I had definite pieces of fishy tasting yellowtail in the ceviche, which if it's almost twice as much as other ceviche anywhere else, I would hope that piece gets removed. (I am picky so I am talking about the grey flesh that's near the belly that often tastes like organ, fishy. It's not as noticeable in cooked seafood but very noticeable in raw.) Service was standard, it takes about 15 minutes to get ceviche and while you wait, there are complimentary chips, although the portion of chips is small. They are in the same building as a number of other restaurants so parking, lot and street, can be bad.

The food tastes just as amazing as it looks, the staff are suuuper friendly, there are a lot of healthier options and it's definitely worth the price!

Positives
1. The ingredients used are SO FRESH!!! (I questioned it, looking at the neighborhood but this is a prime example of when you definitely can NOT judge a book by it's cover)
2. Literally everything we ordered from the ceviche mixto, to the octopus taco, scallop taco, scallop aguachile, chips and sasla (regular salsa AND the creamy extra hot sauce - definitely try both) were amazing! I just wish I had more of an appetite when I got there so I could have ordered and eaten more things from their menu (The portion sizes are not small)!
3. There were so many healthier options that weren't deep fried (raw or grilled options) - This place makes me feel like I'm cheating on my cut!
4. They upcycle!!! The water we were served was literally an old Pellegrino water bottle that had the label removed (and the bottle was clean!). I love it when establishments take environmental responsibility and food safety very seriously.

Negatives
1. I think everyone knows how amazing this spot is because it was still busy even though we came to eat at 3:00 PM.
2. Location - Really close to the Natural History Museum, California Science Center and USC but highly recommend to take an uber or drive because the area is dicey (trust me, I walked there from the museum since it was only 0.6 miles away, or about a 16 minutes walk, but was super sketchy and dirty).

Chef Gilberto's food is fresh, always made to order, and absolutely the best you can get anywhere. His staff is professional, friendly, thoughtful. Yes, thoughtful about the food they serve. If you think contrary to this, I'll fight ya.

This is fine dining without being pretentious. This is fresh food without having to take out your fishing rod. I promise.

Bestest of the the best - you will never go wrong with their ceviche. And if you get their blue fin tuna ceviche, trust me that you'll want to trade in your first born. I almost did.

Bestest for some - their uni (sea urchin) is made with fresh scallops, lightly dabbed with lime juice. You're flooded with thoughts and tastes of the sea and salt. But uni isn't for everyone. I love it.

Best - fish tacos. Boom. You're welcome.

You pay for freshness and the absolute hard work that goes into their food. It's not the cheapest, it's not the most expensive. They do well by this LA community. Read about, partake in their food, love their work and their dedication. Don't scrimp on their tips even if it's a jar.

This is my FAVORITE place in LA. That's saying a lot since I'm from the SGV and I've eaten all over the world. Is it really the best? Yes. It really is. Chichen Itza (across the warehouse) is also gorgeous if you're not looking for seafood.",5 star rating

1925,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Omg this was the best place to accidentally ""stumble"" upon!!! Okay I did find this place on Yelp so before dining here I did see that it had insanely positive reviews but the only reason I found it was because I was in the area (Expo Park) catching up with a friend and we were looking for something to eat for lunch within walking distance. I got the one of the lunch specials which is ceviche mixto and two fish tacos for about $20.

So worth it! The ceviche is such a generous portion, you can share it honestly as an appetizer between two people and then have a decent portion with just the two fish tacos. Obviously if you're trying to get stuffed it might be all good for one person but the portion sizes are generous!

Flavor-wise, I think it definitely hit the spot for me. I don't think you're getting anything fancy here but for what it is and what you're paying, they put so much heart and soul into the flavor and presentation. The ceviche was super fresh and both were nicely put together. I think the fish taco was maybe not super memorable on flavor in the end, but I can see why it's got props from Michelin Bib Gourmand, it's definitely a great value IMO, you get a lot of bang for your buck.

This place is located in a community center in the midst of a food court/bazaar/market type area. I actually had Chichen Itza bookmarked so I'll probably have to find my way back here soon!

But didn't have to look up how Holbox was a recipient of a Micheline Guide Bib Gourmand. Many don't know what that even means. Go look it up.

But do it quick so you can head down to their walk up stall and have some delicious freakin' seafood tacos. They're among the best seafood tacos I've ever had. But first ...

Check in. 1 Free Oyster with Yelp check in. I forgot but it was still honored after I ordered and paid.

Order. Pay. Find a seat. It's a food hall. If it's busy, good luck. Same goes for parking. There's a dedicated lot. Also street parking. Looked to be metered. Not sure. I didn't look.

Pulpo and Scallops. On corn tortillas. Only way to have real tacos, IMO. The corn gives it a texture you can't replicate with flour. The ingredients along with the seafood wouldn't be the same. It just works with corn. It just works for me.

There were six of us, my two daughters, their boyfriends, my hubby and myself. We all met there at 5 pm. First, there was plenty of free parking. For DTLA, free parking is a bonus. We ordered kanpachi & uni tostada, scallop angua chile, 6 shrimp tacos, 3 taco de pulpo en su tinta, a dozen oysters and sopa de mariscos. The orders came with free chips and salsa. Everything was super fresh and delicious. We all loved everything! Our bill was $229 which already included a 20% tip. Next time, I would probably skip the oysters since they were tiny and did not really add a lot to the meal experience. We also ordered 3 chicharon tacos from Chichenitza and my eldest daughter ordered 2 servings of rice and beans separately. By the time we were done, we were all very full. With 6 orders of coffee next door and the chicharron tacos, our total dinner expense (including tips) was $287 something, which came to about $48 per person. Not bad for a very satisfying dinner. The other bonus is you can also order from the other stalls. There were plenty of tables too. We have to ask if we can bring our own wine next time, since none of the stalls seem to serve alcohol.

Dishes ordered:
Ceviche de Camarón (Shrimp Ceviche)
Taco de Pescado al Carbon (Grilled Fish Taco)
Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta (Octopus Taco)

The ceviche is a cold dish, so it came out first. The ingredients were fresh, and there was a refreshing punch of acidity from the lime juice. I'm not usually a fan of raw onions, but I loved the red onions in this ceviche for the crucial role they play in the flavor.

Then the octopus and grilled fish tacos came out. The octopus was served over a sofrito made with calamari ink that was so full of flavor. The fish was juicy and beautifully grilled. Both tacos were delicious. A staff member gave me some habanero salsa to try with the tacos, which was fantastic and very spicy.

* Parking and Location *

Holbox is in the Mercado al Paloma almost immediately on the left when you enter. Based on the pictures of the food, it looks like a fancier sit-down restaurant, but it's actually a counter in a small food hall where you order and they bring the food to you. Parking can be a pain. The parking lot isn't that big and some cars are way too big for the smaller spots, but if you're lucky you can get a spot inside or the extended lot may be open. If not, there is street parking as well.

* Food *

Baja Shrimp Taco - The shrimp were F A T omg. They definitely weren't skimping on the shrimp, but being so hefty, the batter:shrimp ratio was a little too skewed to the shrimp side. The sauces on the taco didn't taste like too much, but when I added the salsa from the complimentary chips, it took the taco to a whole new level.

Scallop Taco - Even though the scallops were seared, they were overall still oretty mushy. Again, the sauces overall didn't really have any flavor. It's not even like I'm saying I don't like the sauces, I just don't even taste them.

Taco de Pulpo en su Tinta - Not sure the sweetness of the calamari ink complemented the octopus well, but the octopus has pretty decent texture.

Baja Fish Taco - The fish was good. Tender and moist with great batter, but unfortunately the overall flavor again fell short. I'd get it again to pair with the salsas but without the salsas, the taco itself didn't stand out.

Oysters - I personally don't like raw oysters unless they're tiny just because I don't like the texture while chewing through it and I also don't like the briny taste. These little ones though were just a little sandy but not briny or overly mushy at all. I could do these again.

Blood Clams - The half order came with 5 of these and wow they were tart. They tasted fresh but the vinegar was way too strong.

Passion Fruit Agua Fresca - Very watered down to the point where there was almost no passion fruit taste at all ):

Honestly disappointed that this was a miss for me because the food all looks amazing and the reviews were so high.

I ordered the Ceviche Mixto and a Taco de Scallop. Also took advantage of my free oyster from checking in on Yelp. Everyone is served complementary chips and salsa.

The wait for my food wasn't long - under 10 mins. Oysters came first and they were fressssssh! Next came the Ceviche.

A few days later my roomate sends me a link to the place telling me we have to check it out because his coworker highly recommended it. I took at as a sign as my craving for a good bite of ceviche and unos tacos de pescado came to life. As a good roomate that I am, I didn't wait for my roomate and selfishly decided to treat myself to a nice lunch on a Friday afternoon . (Not to worry, I made it up to him by going again with him a few days later). I ordered the ceviche de pescado served with the catch of the day which happened to be a lovely and refreshing tuna that day. I also ordered 2 tacos de pescado; uno al carbón, and the other one battered and fried. Todo estaba más que delicioso! The whole experience really blew my ""vegetarian"" socks off!

They bring you your beautiful little dishes (not so little) and everything absolutely everything is fresh, flavorful, and makes you question if you can really go back to being a vegetarian! As I mentioned, everything was soooo amazing that I returned again 2 days later with my roomate! He loved it, I loved it and although I'm back to being a vegetarian, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys seafood! Disfruten!",5 star rating

Parking was in a lot right beside the outdoor dining area - free and super convenient.

We ordered an oyster, Pulpo en Su Tinta (Octopus taco), Taco de Pescado el Carbon (wood blackened fish), and Baja Shrimp Taco. They were all super well made, but I'd have to say that I personally loved the Pulpo en Su Tinta because I thought it was very different and loved the calamari ink (it was surprisingly tart and made the taco amazing).

*Ceviche Mixto: Very refreshing rockfish, octopus, and shrimp to be eaten with one crunchy tostada.
*Baja Shrimp Tacos: The shrimp were huuuge and super juicy. Pair with their sauces!
*Salmon al Carbon: Wood grilled salmon filet with rice, beans, pico de gallo, and avocado. The salmon was cooked to perfection...not a hint of dryness. Make your own taco with their handmade corn tortillas.

1988,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"My girlfriend and I both became sick after eating here. We've eaten the six seafoods we tried here multiple times before without problems (and all as raw except the octopus). My skin turned red from head-to-toe six hours after eating then my girlfriend had the same problem with her skin flaring about 15 hours after eating. The inflammation wasn't serious as there wasn't any swelling of the throat or tongue but my girlfriend still woke me in the middle of the night in a panic thinking she was having a medical emergency. We both spent extra time on the toilet. Our cases cleared after about five hours which meant this was not an allergic reaction but most likely a bacteria problem from tainted food.

The ceviche was bits of seafood added into an overwhelming amount of pico de gallo. A large ceviche mixto with octopus, shrimp, and tuna probably uses an entire red onion. The kanpachi ceviche topped with uni needed instructions or a change of presentation. The uni was laid on top which failed to combine nicely on the palate. The mixture tasted better when obliterating the uni into a sauce which provided a salty brininess with every bite and helped fight off the excess of pico de gallo.

Both the octopus taco and the scallop taco had finely cooked proteins. Additionally, I loved the deep and exquisitely complex richness of the sofrito and the caramelized red onions mixed with a chile pepper sauce that came with these dishes. Unfortunately, they were incomplete dishes that lacked acidity or textural crunchiness. Cherry tomatoes and marinated fennel tried to fill these roles but just weren't enough.

On the flip side, the Baja fish taco didn't have a sexy-rich sauce but the fried rockfish had texture from the crunchy batter coating and the bed of sliced red cabbage. Although the fish taco was the cheapest item on the menu, it was curiously the best we tried.

A man shucking the oysters to order.

I saw this place on Instagram and always wanted to try. I was expecting a restaurant that's very high-end or in a different area. So I was pretty shocked when I arrived at the place.

We got seated at the bar area and started to order.

The oysters are VERY fresh, I believe the oysters they served were kumamoto (I might be wrong it's been a minute)

The blood clams were served very fresh with a little squeeze of lime!

Their Octopus taco is amazing, its worth EVERY SINGLE penny, very tender and how they braised it was definitely the right way to go! The marinade on the octopus very much complimented the sauce and the tortilla.

Uni tostada, to my surprise they give you a hefty amount of uni. I think that the tostada would've been better without the uni but still it was delicious!

I also got the scallop sashimi dish. The bit of salsa that was on top of the scallops took away any fishiness, even though they were fresh, scallops sometimes have their unique smell to it.

I recommend this place!!

Literally you can find better tacos at taco trucks around south LA. This place is just a spot for the gentrified people living around here.

""yeah, we also ended up on the michelin roundup this year. and last year too,"" he said.

""oh,"" i said dumbly, and ordered three dishes to cover up my embarrassment.

so the thing is. this place isn't super expensive. it's no taco bell value menu ($28 total for my hungry belly) but it is really fucking good.

i THINK the half-eaten dish in this picture is the blood clams-- they were served on a tostada, with shrimp cocktails and some tomato/onion/cilantro business to go with it. i simply cannot recommend this item enough-- i squeezed some extra lime on top, and that rendered these clams absolutely ELECTRIC with flavor. just a really good seafood dish if you're a fan of fishies.

the smoked kanpachi taco was fine. the avocado was a good, buttery touch. but it was really hard to follow those clams imo, and the bottom of the taco was a little soggy.

and if you're broke & looking for something that won't break the bank, please get the baja fish taco ($5). it is the most considerate taco that has ever entered my mouth. the cabbage slaw was shredded finely, the fish was breaded lightly, and the slight dribble of mayo added just enough moisture to the whole thing without being sloppy. as i demolished this taco, some cabbage juice dribbled out of it and stained the plate purple. very metaphorical of the massacre that had just taken place.

Holbox was located in a food court. Judged by the look with counter service and all, I would assume the restaurant only serves street food like ceviches and tacos for the lunch crowds. Since I did my homework, I found out chef Cetina had 20 plus years of experience specialized in Yucatan style Mexican food. I was pretty excited for our dinner.

The dinner menu came with 7 courses, followed by my favorite dessert chef Turok's mascarpone cheesecakes. The cheesecakes were charged separately but it was totally worth it. The 7 courses were: blood clams, surf clams, yellowtail ceviche, scallop aquachile, seafood soup, pan seared scallop, and wood grilled kampachi.

First we got a bag of chips and salsa. It was perfect because I also wanted to sample all the hot sauces on the table and the chips made a great holder for it. The hot sauces were smoking hot but very good in flavors. My favorite was the roasted habanero garlic.

We got blood clam and surf clam as our starter. I've had Vietnamese style blood clam, but never had it raw. It was intense with the iron taste, and it looked like it was soaking in blood. So cool. Surf clam was crunchy and fresh. This was a good start.

Next we got yellowtail ceviche. From my understanding it usually comes with uni but I guess last minute change so no uni for our dish. It tasted well but nothing too exciting about this dish.

The scallop aquachile was really good. The sauce was not overly spicy and helped to enhance the sweetness of the scallop. A very refreshing dish. I wasn't too sure why the avocado was needed, but it made the dish pretty.

After that we had the seafood soup. The broth was made with fish and shrimp shells, and brought the sea to the bowl. Even though there wasn't a lot, it was refined and very different from the usual Mexican seafood soup.

Pan seared scallop was my favorite of the night. It had poblano pepper, mushrooms, cream and fennel in it. The scallop was perfectly cooked with excellent texture. Everything worked well in one bite and this is a must if you come here.

The star of the night was the wood grilled kampachi. A whole fish was grilled for everyone to share and every part was edible. We were also given a taco set to eat with the fish. The flavor of the fish was pretty mild but the meat was tender. Asides from the meat around the belly area, I also asked for the fish head. There was so much meat in the head that it was a meal itself. If you know how to destroy a fish head, you would appreciate how I ate mine. I guess people around me were shocked.

For the cheesecakes, we had 3 different flavors to pick from and since we got enough people, we tried all 3. They were key lime, pecan, and cream brulee. Not overly sweet and my favorite was the cream brulee.

Overall, I really loved what we had. The meal was way over our expectations and the service was friendly. There was really nothing negative about the experience and we will definitely go back again for different things.",5 star rating
2030,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Sal: This is about the 4th or 5th time I've had the pleasure of eating at this place. The first time I tried it was on a whim while attending an LAFC match and looking for food to eat nearby. It was one of my luckiest and best decisions I've made in my life to order seafood from a little stand in a food court hidden away from the main roads. Every time I come back I'm blown away by the freshness and the flavorful experience each bite provides. I feel like every bite I take transports me to a five star resort on a beautiful beach in Mexico and when I open my eyes I realize that in still sitting in a busy food court in the heart of Los Angeles. This place is the definition of a hole in the wall and a hidden gem. I can't say enough about how good this place is and hopefully one day they move on to opening there own restaurant to accommodate the flocks of people coming to eat there because everyone should try this place.

Eli: before arriving I had high expectations for this place. My boyfriend was so excited to show me one of his greatest discoveries. His tradition of coming to grab a bite at this place after an LAFC match lives on. We were upon the first few people to trickle in after the match and the atmosphere wasn't overwhelming, but it was busy. It was a food court filled with people of all ages. It was authentic and nice. At the entrance they do check your COVID vaccine card and ID. As we made our way up to the counter and looked through the menu I immediately became excited. The menu is full of many options and they all look so delicious. I ended up going with the taco de pulpo en su tinta (octopus taco in its ink) and the camarones al mojo de ajo (garlic shrimp). I was not disappointed. The food was so fresh and everything is done right before your eyes at the counter. Beware that seating is extremely limited as there are only bar stools at the counter to sit at. Before I knew it the line was out the door and people were willing to stand in line for 30 minutes and then wait another half hour for their food. Luckily, since we had beat the crowd out food was our fairly quickly and we found seating. Every bite was full of flavor and did not disappoint. Definitely amongst the best sea food I've ever had.",5 star rating

5 stars for the seafood itself

My friend and I decided to do a Taco Crawl and had to narrow it down to 2-3 spots. I had Holbox bookmarked for so long and since I love seafood this was an easy pick. Holbox is located inside a public market. Think of the Downtown Grand Central Market but way smaller and less packed. I believe they do have an open parking lot, but it was filled so luckily we found street parking. They have several tables scattered around, but Holbox was set around a small counter table, so you can see the action. At the counter they have 4 different hot sauce, ALL very spicy. I can't do spice so for some it may be a good kick.

If you have yelp, you get a free oyster if you check in. I was excited but I will tell you, this was one of the worst oysters I've had. It had such a grimy horrible aftertaste, my friend and I could not get that taste out of our palette. I know it's complimentary but that does not mean it should taste so bad. Luckily the complimentary chips and salsa were very good. The chips were so crunchy and fresh and the salsa was acidic and not that spicy.

_Ceviche Mixto (Sm $10 / Lrg $18) rock fish, mexican octopus, wild mexican shrimp, cilantro, tomato, lime, onion and salsa roja. Presentation was eye appealing. The seafood were all fresh and the flavors were very mild. Nothing too acidic or sweet, pretty standard. I wish they added more citrus, I felt something was missing.
_Wood Grilled Fish Taco ($6.50 ea) Wood grilled kanpachi, cabbage, handmade corn tortilla, morita sauce, mayo and pico de gallo. The fish was cooked perfectly and a nice portion. The tortilla was good, as you can tell it was homemade but it was a bit too thick for such a delicate fish. I felt it overpowered it, and thought the tortilla would have been better with a meat or stew type of taco as it was a bit dense.
_Taco de Pulpo en su tinta ($6 ea) Braised and fried mexican octopus, calamari ink sofrito on a hand made tortilla. I must say this was one of the best cooked octopus I've ever had. It was so tender and soft and well seasoned. Because the octopus was so well cooked I felt they added way too much sofrito, which took away from the simplicity of the octopus. The squid ink was great but once we took out half the sofrio and tortilla you can really showcase all the flavors in a perfect ratio.
_Scallop Taco ($7 ea) Pan seared maine diver scallops, handmade tortilla, chile x'catic sauce, caramelized onions and fennel. 2 jumbo scallops that were perfectly cooked and had a bit of a glaze that added a touch of sweetness. Again another taco which I felt the tortilla was a bit heavy for the delicate fish. I would have ate the scallops alone or with some sweet potato puree.
_Baja Fish Taco ($4 ea) Battered and fried wild rock fish, cabbage, crema, mayo and salsa roja on handmade corn tortilla. This was the best taco out of all the above. A chunky perffectly fried fish that was flavorful and has the right amount of cabbage, mayo and salsa.

Overall it was a great experience and I will say hands down, Holbox executes their seafood perfectly, but it all came down to the fact that either the ratio was off or the tortilla was too heavy for the lightness and freshness of the fish. A pretty hefty price as well for an individual taco, but you pay for the quality and overall creativity.",4 star rating

2035,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"***Jonathan Gold's #39 of LA (2017): Holbox***

Got to cross another restaurant off my list this past weekend, but I'm not entirely sure I am satisfied after my first visit. For those unaware, Holbox is a restaurant located inside of Downtown's Mercado La Paloma in Historic South Central, Los Angeles. It's basically a restaurant stand inside of a food court, a few blocks away from USC. It's not the nicest neighborhood to explore, but this restaurant seemed promising. Jonathan Gold has described this Yucatán-style seafood restaurant as ""transcendent,"" and I was quite curious to see what the hype is all about. Raw fish is one of my favorite foods, adding even more to my anticipation and excitement.

Holbox was actually the first restaurant stand I saw upon walking into the complex. The space felt very clean, making the idea of eating raw seafood there comforting. The counter was spotless. This is the kind of place where you order and pay at the front, then find a table and wait for your food to be prepared and delivered. They have a few bar seats overlooking the kitchen/operations, and luckily there were a couple spots open around 2pm on the Sunday we visited.

I asked the cashier for his recommendation before ordering, and he told me that the ceviche mixto was their most popular item. Being my first time here, I decided to go with it. Priced at $16 a plate, it's not the cheapest place in town to grab lunch at, but the seafood here is definitely quality. My ceviche mixto consisted of Baja Halibut, gulf shrimp, Spanish octopus, onion, tomato, lime juice, cilantro, avocado puree, and salsa roja.

The seafood was extremely fresh and flavorful. In fact, I was quite a bit overwhelmed by the flavor. In my opinion, the marinade overpowered the dish, making it hard to taste the actual seafood. I honestly could not eat that much of it without taking a break. The seafood was great, just the sour flavor was a little too much for me. The quantity was decent, but not particularly generous. That being said, the quality cannot be denied. I was impressed by how tender the octopus was, in particular.

Tip: Check in on Yelp for a free oyster with your $10 purchase. The oyster was top notch!

All in all, my experience here was good. I wasn't blown away as I was hoping, but the ceviche was certainly delicious. This restaurant does have a lot to offer, and I think I'll have to head back to try more of their dishes. The uni and Yellowtail look great, though I didn't see any uni on the menu when I was there. I'm not entirely satisfied with my first visit, but it was undoubtedly a positive experience. If you're into ceviche and/or raw seafood, go ahead and check this place out. It will not disappoint.",4 star rating

Everything was amazing. There were some special deals including a combo with ceviche and two Baja fish tacos. That's what my friend got. I got an octopus taco and the scallop aguachile. I loved everything but the scallop aguachile was on another level. The scallops were so fresh and melted in your mouth. The mixture of the avocado and the nice lime flavor was just perfect. The batter on the Baja fish tacos was also so good. And the octopus taco- one of the most tender pieces of octopus I've ever had.

They also give you chips while you're waiting and there are several different sauces to try which is fun.

Now it'a not cheap but for the quality of what yo get, it's totally worth it. The aguachile by itself was $16. But you need it. Trust me.

I felt lucky to find a spot in the lot - it's not huge and most of the spots were filled when we got there midday. I could see it being a challenge if I came again.

The tortilla on the tacos was soft, nice corn texture and flavor. Each order comes with salsa and chips. The place was super clean on the counter and the employees were wearing masks and gloves to prepare food.

You will receive one free oyster with your yelp check-in with over $10 order of food. Personally I think the oysters in LA aren't that fresh, but the oyster here was good.

We ordered a kanpachi uni tostada (since they ran out of the whole uni), a Coctel de Cameron (cocktail shrimp), a scallop aquachile, a grilled whole Branzino, a scallop taco, and an octopus taco.

The Kanpachi uni tostada was good, however it was nothing special, just like how a lot of other restaurants would make it, it was pretty.

The shrimp cocktail was way too sweet, we barely touched it.

The scallop taco was my favorite of the night. The scallop was soft and sweet, it was cooked to perfection. I also loved their tortilla.

The grilled octopus taco wasn't good, the octopus was very dry and hard.

The grilled Branzino was delicious, it was cooked perfectly, it was better than a lot of the ""big"" restaurants. However, the rice that came with it was too soft for my taste, also had an odd flavor.

The scallop aquachile was good, the scallops were fresh, and they were generous with their avocado.

Our chef and the bus boy were nice. However the cashier girl wasn't very friendly, when we asked her if we could wait and sit at the bar, she said no. And when I asked her if anyone was leaving soon, she said no one was almost done. But within five minutes two couples got up and left, within ten minutes the bar cleared up and everyone left! she even forgot to give us change.

All at once, the crunchy batter, creamy fish, rich starchy tortilla and acid, sweet, savory notes all come together in a crescendo of flavors.
The star of my meal was definitely the octopus taco. The ends were crispy. The center was soft and delicate. I inhaled this taco so fast that I could not care less of it's individual elements. The octopus taco was simply delicious.

2067,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"This was a great experience. I must say, it was my first time trying both ceviche and octopus, so I can't compare to anything I've had before, but I was very pleased. I found the lemon on the ceviche a bit strong but as I understand it, that is standard.

My party ordered several ceviche and tacos and everyone loved their food. I was extremely happy to know that the ceviche and the pico de Gallo are made freshly to order, which means that you can request certain items to be left out (I'm looking at you, fellow cilantro soap tasters). I was able to try ceviche for the first time since they could prepare it without cilantro!

The staff were very friendly and eager to please. They even gave us three free oysters for the three Yelper check ins we had in our party. I would definitely come here again. One thing that could be improved a bit is the atmosphere. Since this place is in an odd location, and inside the food court the seating is a free for all, clean tables can be hard to come by.

Despite the hole in the wall feel, don't be surprised when your tacos and ceviche come out looking ""plated"" because this place is Michelin rated and they aren't messing around.",4 star rating

The Octopus and Grilled Fish tacos are AMAZING. The flavors go so well together and nothing is too overwhelming. The squid ink in the octopus taco definitely gives it a huge flavor blast, but the octopus remains the main player in this dish.

The fish taco is light and crispy and not overly oily. The mayo is a lovely addition to give it more unctuousness without being heavy. The ceviche has nice chunks of meat and isn't overly sour. The chips are fresh and crunchy and they give you a lot too.

FOOD: Seafood tasted fresh with rich flavors! Got the kanpachi ceviche, 1/2 dozen oysters, pulpo asado, and scallop tacos, split it amongst 3 people. Every dish was great; if I had to pick a favorite, it would be the scallop taco. Added bonus: they have a selection of 5+ hot sauces that all have a real kick to them!",5 star rating
2073,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"If you're looking for some high quality and unique tacos, this place is the place to go to! I heard about this place through a video on facebook, and it did not disappoint. It's located in a food court and there's minimal seating if you want to watch your food being made, but there are plenty of other seats further away throughout the food court. It's a little pricy - i think our lunch came out to be ~$70), but that is to be expected for high quality food and tacos that are michelin recommended. What I ordered:

Octopus Tacos (Taco de pulpo en su tinta) (5/5): LOVEEED these. Octopus was soft and had great taste to it, not too chewy like you would imagine for octopi. I really liked the sauce on this too, though not sure what it was. It was probably my favorite dish andd it's actually better than the regular octopus dish that comes with rice that this place also serves (pulpo asado).

Scallop Tacos (5/5): Also loved these too, but maybe I'm biased cause I really love scallops.

Scallop aquachile ceviche (5/5): Also loved this. Super spicy and fresh, nothing like I've ever tasted and I feel like it would be very hard to come across this dish elsewhere.

Pulpo Asado (3/5): Wasn't really a big fan of this. Even though it included the octopus it wasn't as soft as the octopus in the tacos?? And me and my bf wasn't really a big fan of the rice there either.

So really I would just come back for the ceviche and tacos. Be sure to check in as they offer a free oyster if you check in!

It didn't have the crema, but there's so many other sauces to add if you're into that. The scallops taco was also great. My friend said he loves his grilled fish taco which is supposed to be their best seller.

The fishmonger at Holbox is bringing freshness you don't see very often. They have so much goodness here from live lobsters, and fresh whole fish. This is the best fried fish taco I have ever had. This is not Ensenada style, but a very delicate coating which does not take away from the fish. This fish didn't taste frozen, which already sets it apart. I tried the grilled and fried fish, and they are both excellent. The octopus taco was not my cup of tea. The squid ink was piled high on top of the taco, it overpowered the octopus. The octopus was tender, but for me it would have been better without the huge mound of squid ink. I'm glad I gave it a go, my friend backed out from trying all that black goo. The scallop taco was also very good, and the fresh sweetness of the grilled scallop came through.",5 star rating
2078,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"I have come to realize that there are two major divisions in the realm of raw seafood: Japanese Sushi-Sashimi, and the Latino-Hispanic tradition of Ceviche-Aguachiles. Of course there is the Crudo/raw of Italy, & Tiraditos of Peru which seem to reference itself back somewhat to Japan since Japanese emigrants to Peru may have accelerated this development.

Hol Box (ol bosh) in Yucatecan Mayan language means ""black hole"" & refers to an island where there is a small lagoon whose bottom is dark in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. It is famous for its lobster & other seafood. So Hol Box in the Mercado Paloma serves nothing but ""fruits"" from the sea unlike its sister restaurant that serves a more varied Yucatecan cuisine.

1) Entered the meal w/ Pata de Mula/Mexican Blood Clams which seem to bleed dark red blood as it is shucked from its shell. Chopped onions, cilantro leaf, lime juice w/ a squirt of Morita Salsa which to me has sweet-sour of tamarindo, bit piquant w/ a faint smokiness. This clam has varying texture depending on the body part: chewy, crunchy, sinewy, soft w/ an ocean minerality that seems to have a bit of iron from the hemoglobin like blood.

2) Halibut & Uni Ceviche Tostada: The fried corn tortilla is thick, rough, crunchy in order to not get soggy from its huge load of diced white meat halibut marinated in citrus juice which ""cooks"" the meat so it is a bit leathery in texture as well as enlivening it w/ a bit of gastrique.

There is a creamy spring green aguacate/avocado puree slathered onto the tortilla, chiffonade of green & red onions, finely diced tomato, scattering of cilantro microgreens, halibut, & five flat slivers of Uni/sea urchin crowning it all.

Perhaps aging the halibut w/ Japanese Kombu/kelp would infuse more sea sweetness & increase the Umami of the halibut since marinating in citrus juice seems to cover up those features already in the halibut. Uni is not marinated so it still retains its subtle sweet, unique sea minerality.

3) Callo de Hacha Aguachile: Slices of Mexican Half Moon scallops swimming in lightly sour lime juice dyed green w/ pureed cilantro leaves, Serrano chiles. There is a hill of diced rich, fatty, ripe aquacate, red onions. Again the acidity of the lime juice somewhat ""cooks"" the scallops for a bit of leathery texture on the surface. Touch of piquancy & the green herbal funk of cilantro comes into play as a contrast to the sweet meat of the scallops.

Since the Mercado Paloma prohibits alcohol there was no Cerveza Montejo from the Yucatan nor Bohemia or Negra Modelo to pair w/ the seafood. Their just barely sweet fresh lemonade was good for refreshing the palate.

4) Oh, super Yelper Isobel L. reminded me to check in so I got a freebie Coos Bay Oyster w/ just a squeeze of lime juice. The juice of the oyster has a strong, clean brininess, & the meat is soft & silky.

Seafood is becoming ever more dear due much to the fact that we are overfishing everywhere. Premium seafood is a luxury item. So the 3 generously portioned dishes came up to be over $50 including tax & tip which under the circumstances is reasonable. Staff is helpful & friendly. 4+ Yelp stars for a rare look at Yucatecan style Crudo de Mariscos/seafood.",4 star rating

If you like seafood and you like tacos, Holbox is a must.

I came for the octopus, scallop, and fish tacos and they did not disappoint. Definitely the best scallop and fish tacos I've ever had. The octopus was al dente on a bed of calamari ink sofrito. There's just something about how the flavors work together with the taco that made it one of the most interesting and delicious bites of something new I've had in quite some time.

I have to call out the handmade tortillas: I think they are the foundation of why these tacos are such a pleasure to eat. They are not just a vehicle for the taco meat of choice--they add to the flavors and textures to bring you the perfect taco in every bite.

2081,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"After having eaten many, many times at Holbox and Chef Cetina's other fine restaurant Chichen Itza, one day I randomly asked Chef if he would consider planning a special tasting menu for a small group of dining enthusiasts, thinking that it was worth a chance and that probably the answer would be no. Luckily for me, Chef actually agreed and surprised us (me and fellow Elite Yelpers Kim T and Gary I) with an incredible, out-of-this-world, amazing seafood adventure that completely blew away my expectations for what a tasting menu at Holbox would be. I had thought that Chef might put together some dishes from his regular menu for us, maybe with a special twist....but no. Like the truly exceptional chef that he is, he created a special and unique tasting menu unlike any other I've ever had. His menu showcased not only the freshest of seafood that Holbox is known for but also Chef's incredible skills and depth of knowledge of seafood cuisine. This is a man whose career choice is perfectly aligned with his passion...and it shows. We were treated not only to an absolutely delicious dinner but also a master class in seafood preparation given by Chef himself.

Please see my photos for more details of the dishes that were presented. I will highlight a few here:

Diver Scallop: Chef's presentation of this perfectly cooked scallop was stunning: the scallop was cooked in its own shell then brought to table by Chef himself and opened up for a magical moment....abracadabra!

Seafood Bisque: Chef told us how he simmered all the unused parts of our other seafood ingredients for a complete nose-to-fin use of the prawns and fish, whipped the broth up with some uni, and topped it off with mussles cooked in wine and chilled king crab. A total showstopper.

Cardinal Prawn: Chef obtained some of these bright red prawns for our dinner and served them over rice cooked in squid ink for the grand finale. The rice tasted like the perfect risotto, rich and flavorful, and was a wonderful pairing for the delicious prawn. Absolutely incredible.

Chef Cetina's tasting menu revealed the depth and breadth of his culinary talents. I've had a lot of tasting menus in a lot of different restaurants in this town and this was by far my favorite, ever. Chef personally prepared all our dishes and allowed us to witness his process while giving us all the details for every dish. He answered all our questions with a smile. What an unbelievable experience; I would give 10 stars if I could. Thank you very much to all the staff at Holbox and most of all to Chef Cetina for an unforgettable tasting menu.",5 star rating
2082,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Really fresh seafood!! I absolutely love that a lot of the flavors come from the taste of seafood instead of loads of sauces or a thick coat of batter. Every taco has great combination of flavors. I can never decide which tacos I want and/or if I will have more room for the other dishes. The only weird thing is one time I ordered a ceviche, and instead of tortilla, it came with saltine crackers?

Extra sauces are not needed because fresh seafood tastes amazing! But they do have a very small sauce bar if you need. Every sauce on the counter is very spicy, so please have a taste before drowning you beautiful tacos.

Another upside with eating here is the location! Parking lot is never full, and the upside with being in the food court is that there are other great options if your party isn't down for seafood or the high price point. Chichen Itza down the hall is another amazing nice taco place, and I also really like the juice place across!",5 star rating
2083,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Chef Gilberto Centina (of Holbox and Chichen Itza) and Staff, thank you again so much!!! Us three lucky Yelpers were so blessed & honored that we got to try out your first ever 7 Course Tasting Menu. Each dish was executed flawlessly & I'm so in love w/the Box Crab & Spanish Cardinal Spot Prawn that you had introduced to us! My love for seafood has newly elevated thanks to you!!!

Of course, super thanks to Yelper Isobel L. for inviting us to this special occasion! Her hard work & dedication to dining here & reaching out to Chef Centina in putting together a first ever Tasting Menu, you rock, Isobel!

Seven Course Tasting Menu: $100 per person (which also includes the drinks listed below).

Complimentary Chips & Salsa: We got there early and so we were served complimentary chips & salsa. The chips were crispy & crunchy. I preferred dipping it w/the sweet & mild Chile Morita Hot Sauce (one of the five homemade sauces created by Chef Centina).

Drinks: Mexican Coke, Iced Water & Sparkling Lemonade were all inclusive w/our dinner, yay! I started off w/Mexican Coke & Iced Water first. By the 5th Course, I had the Sparkling Lemonade, which was great because the mixture of Sparkling Pellegrino water & lemonade helped, especially, w/reducing down the hearty richness of the last two courses.

Course 1: Seafood Trio: (1 Oyster, 1 Blood Clam and 1 Giant Surf Clam - sliced & mixed w/Chef Centina's homemade ceviche sauce). Under Chef Centina's direction, we started off in that order. The oyster itself was sweet & succulent, shucked very clean. Next, the blood clam tasted a bit tangier & brinier. Looks kind of gross but tasted really good. Lastly, the Giant Surf Clam Ceviche mixed was fabulous! The clam itself tasted sweet & the ceviche mixture paired w/the complimentary chips was sooo good!

Course 2: Kampachi (Yellowtail) Ceviche w/Santa Barbara Uni. Before we began the next course, Chef Centina gave us each a sample of Kampachi to taste, which was smooth & fresh. Chopped up Kampachi, tomatoes, onions & red bell peppers, topped w/two pieces of fresh Uni, wow! Of all the dishes, this was the spiciest for me (my lips felt a slight burning sensation) since the red sauce underneath was Arbol-Guajillo (chili peppers). Luckily, the green sauce was cooler & milder.

Course 3: Spot Prawn & Bay Scallops in Agua Chile, served w/Crispy Spot Prawn Head. The live Spot Prawns were killed in front of us, aww! But, the meat was fresh & sweet. Served w/sliced Bay Scallops poured over the Agua Chile (serrano chilies, cilantro & lime juice). Even the head of the Spot Prawn was fried crispy & edible. Midway through the meal, Chef Centina asked how the heat was for me since this dish had a lot of chilies. That was very sweet of him since my palate was spicy sensitive. The level of heat was perfect.

Course 4: Box Crab Salad (Top Stand-Out): We were introduced to this type of crab called a Box Crab. When touched, the crab forms a defensive box shaped appearance, hence the name. The meat was very sweet & delectable! The crab meat was mixed w/mayo, cucumbers & diced green apples. It was then placed in a circular mode w/sliced avocado & served w/diced green apples on the side. Underneath was the Arbol-Peanut Soy Sauce. I, so wanted more!

Course 5: Diver Scallop w/Smoky Fennel: Presented in its shell w/smoky fennel leaves underneath. The scallop was light pan-seared w/butter, light vinaigrette & fennel juice. Served along w/its roe & fried gills. I never had the roe & fried gills before & it was lovely!

Course 6: Seafood Medley Bisque (Top Stand-Out #3): Wow, this one was extremely rich & omg, melts-in-your-mouth goodness! This would absolutely be perfect for an extremely cold winter/rainy day. Consisting of Kamapachi Bone Broth, Saffron & Uni puree, liquid from the Box Crab carcass, Snow Crab Claws, Mussels, Clams, Spot Prawn Shell, so smooth & creamy, pure seafood porn!

Course 7: Spanish Cardinal Prawn w/Calamari Inked Rice (Top Stand-Out #2). The final meal of the night, so much better than dessert! We never heard of this type of prawn before, but we're so glad we got to try it! The meat was sweet & very succulent, especially, the head. When squeezing it, the liquid bisque it forms is A-MAZ-ING!!!! Paired w/the calamari ink rice underneath (soft & creamy), what a perfect way to end the meal!

Service: It was definitely a labor of love w/all the hard work preparing, crafting & presenting each dish deliciously & flawlessly. I also very appreciative that Chef Centina kept my spicy sensitivity in mind. 100% service on-point!

Overall, it was truly and honor and blessing to be the first ones ever to try out a Tasting Menu from Chef Centina. The love & passion that Chef Centina & Staff here put into the seafood dishes has definitely won my heart & patronage! Definitely worth the return over & over again!",5 star rating

I gotta say this place is amazing with its authenticity and the fish tacos they serve.

My two friends and I all got one octopus taco and one grilled fish taco each. We came on a Sunday and after this place was exposed on Buzzfeed, it was more crowded than ever. The octopus taco was probably the best seafood taco I've ever had in my life. The taco was grilled but it was still very tender. The grilled fish is very tasty with the different sauces on it.

The seafood is some of the freshest I've ever had. When you order at the counter, you can see stunning bloodclams and oysters on ice. You may even see Chef Centina himself butchering a fish or schucking a bivalve. I love that Holbox is a simple stall in a cafeteria-like setting but serves some of the most decadent seafood items. This is definitely the most expensive stall at Mercado La Paloma but for the quality and decadence of ingredients offered, it is very reasonably priced for LA standards. Tacos are 2 for $10, tostadas are $7 and a tostada with UNI will cost you $12.

Now onto the food. WOW. The ono tacos were the best fish tacos I've ever had. The fish was seasoned well and seared just enough to have a flakey crust while keeping the inside relatively uncooked. The house made mayo sauce was perfectly creamy and the cabbage slaw was crunchy and flavorful. The corn tortilla is home-made and thick--it's easily my favorite tortilla of all time. All these simple perfections add up to form the most amazing fish taco of my life.

The ceviche mixto is also incredible: fresh fish and pulpo, chopped into the perfect sized pieces and marinated with the perfect amount of citrus. This must be the ceviche of the gods. I have yet to try the tostada with uni but I intend to on my next treat yo'self lunch.

2090,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"If you search for Holbox, you may find that it is in island in Mexico on the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. This is because Gilbert Centina Jr. only recently opened his new casual food court seafood installation at Mercado la Paloma. Soon, Holbox will be known for serving the freshest, most affordable and incredibly flavorful seafood in Los Angeles.

I love Mercado la Paloma. I love the variety, and I love the community atmosphere. Holbox is now right by the entrance, and it's bright façade entices beckons you in. If you are a party of 2, I highly recommend sitting at the counter wrapped around the stand, but there are tables for larger parties. You can take a look at the catch of the day in the case (including looking into its very clear eyes), and watch the chef at work over his mise en place, exhibiting his genius at every turn.

Our party ordered a sampler of items from the menu. There was no line, which is incredible to me. Soon, the line will be out the door. First, each person is given a little paper sack of fresh tortilla chips with a plastic cup of the best smokey and sweet salsa in town. The salsa is flecked with carrots as well as fresh cilantro and can be drunk by the cupful (trust me). We shared:

Empanadas de Cazon ($9): three envelopes of fried masa contain chopped smoked shark, are drizzled with a black bean sauce and are served with minced tomato and onion sofrito. The shark is incredibly tender, the ""crust"" is flakey and the sweet, cooked tomato sauce and sweet and meaty black bean sauce are each perfectly executed.

Black Cod Tacos ($9): two corn tortillas have a filet of buttery and flakey black cod that is clean tasting and perfectly seasoned. The grilled dish is topped with romaine, chopped cabbage, micro greens, pico de gallo, and a drizzle of the smokey and mild arbol-guajillo sauce. Perfectly prepared and absolutely delish.

Chile Rellenos ($9): three yellow chiles are filled with minced yellow tail and then are breaded and fried and served atop shredded romaine with a drizzle of crema and morita sauce. This was my favorite dish of the day. The chiles had a little heat that was offset by the cool, crisp fish within. The crust was crunchy and the smokiness of the roasted chile sauce complimented the whole dish.

Snapper Ceviche ($8): a crunchy corn tortilla was topped with hunks of tangy marinated red snapper on a drizzle of avocado and under a drizzle of salsa roja with cilantro, micro greens and pico de gallo. The tostadas are a revelation - perfectly prepared ceviche that is made to order with a little smokey salsa, a bit of rich avocado, and some verdant greens. My only complaint is that I was also served the Ceviche Mixto Tostada ($6) rather than the cocktel mixto ($10) that I ordered, because of an error by the server doing the input. As a result, I had the same dish twice, but with octopus, and shrimp. I would have rather had the sweet shrimp and the most incredibly tender, but still meaty, octopus that I have ever had in my life in the house made sauce. C'est la vie; I should have looked at my receipt more closely and asked for a correction.

Scallop al Carbon ($9): this is probably the one dish that I would not order again. The seared scallop with a tomato based sauce and minced chives served in a shell has nice buttery and smokey notes with a lot of sweet that will not disappoint, but it pales in comparison to the other dishes that we sampled.

The fresh lemonade ($2) is tangy and light. It compliments the beachy flavors perfectly. The servers and bussers are friendly, and the chef lets you know what the freshest options are. I am looking forward to returning - I look forward to having the cocktel mixto and the blood clams.

[Mercado la Paloma] is an experiment in community revitalization that provides opportunities for our local residents and showcases our local creativity to the broader Los Angeles community."" By trying the AMAZING food at this restaurant, you're also supporting communities of color and lower SES. Win-win.

Now onto the food: the kanpachi wood grilled fish taco was the best damn taco I've ever had. Now I get why Andrew said this was the best constructed bite of fish he's ever had, INCLUDING the best sushi he's ever had. The octopus taco was surprisingly just okay - the flavor was there but the octopus was slightly overcooked. But that kanpachi taco made it all Worth It (get it?).

The scallop aguachile packed a ton of flavor and heat, and was perfect on a tostada. The uni hamachi tostada is one of my favorite bites of food in LA. I tried the smoked hamachi taco and surprise, it was also delicious. Very smoky, almost reminded me of a Jewish deli style smoked whitefish, except on a taco. The grilled hamachi was all about the fish, which was fresh and perfectly cooked. And finally, the Baja shrimp tacos...I have never ordered their Baja tacos because the menu has so many other great options, but these are officially going on the list. Sweet and golden brown battered shrimp, cabbage, some crema, and I added some of the habanero salsa... The Baja tacos were up there with Baja Ensenada or Ricky's.

2110,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Holbox is seafood taco perfection. The best seafood tacos in all of Los Angeles, possibly California, and possibly beyond that. Everything on this menu is delicious and the rule of thumb here is that if you like that type of seafood (fish, scallop, shrimp, etc)-- you will like what Holbox prepares.

Food: We ordered 2 of every taco on the menu (10 total), the grilled octopus, and the large ceviche to feed 4 people. FYI, the grilled octopus meal uses the same meat and sauces as the grilled octopus taco so in the future we won't order both because it's redundant. All the tacos were fresh, flavorful, and delicious. The scallop, octopus, fish, shrimp, and hamachi (yellowtail) tacos are easily the best in their class from other restaurants I've tried them at.

DO NOT SKIP THE SALSAS, they're homemade at Holbox and they really make the flavors pop in all the foods. Beware how spicy they are but I highly recommend the habanero.

Total cost was $100 but well worth the price for the quality.

Service: You order at the counter and they'll give you a number. Find a table and the food will be brought out. It's speedy, polite, and simple.

Octopus taco: guess I've never had a properly cooked octopus tentacle til now.. So tender and juicy and good! None of that chewiness that puts me off. The black ink sofrito is creamy and delicious.

Baja fish tacos: best battered fish taco I've ever had.

Baja shrimp tacos: heartier than the fresh fish tacos and delicious!

First course - Our dinner started with Pata de Mula & Ostiones which are Blood Clams & oysters served chilled on the half shell. After trying this I thought could have just had that and have been thrilled.

Then the second course arrived of - Aguachile de Callo de Hacha.
Mexican half moon scallops from the Sea of Cortez marinated in lime-cilantro-serrano served cold with avocado. I could not believe how amazing this was. I am determined to try and duplicate this at home because I want it all the time.

The third course was - Ceviche de Jurel con Erizo. Local yellowtail ceviche topped with Santa Barbara Premium Uni. When I come for lunch I usually get the mixed ceviche, but this was amazing and a huge portion.

Then we moved on to the hot dishes. The fourth course started with - Callos con Rajas. Pan seared Maine diver scallops served on top of roasted poblano peppers with sauteed mushrooms & cream. Absolutely perfect. I make these at home and never even considered the poblano peppers.

At this point we are getting full. The fifth dish was grilled octopus. It was good but not my favorite. I love octopus but for some reason I just wasn't feeling it last night.

Sixth course I can't remember the name of this, but it was interesting. Not as firm as shrimp but very tasty. The rice was black from calamari ink.

We thought our dining event had come to an end, but Samuel surprised us, because he's awesome like that. He on the spot whipped up the most amazing Branzino. OMG that was the best way to end the night.

EXCELLENT CEVICHE AND FISH TACOS. Holbox is an extension of Mercado La Paloma's famed Chichen Itza (both Yucatan cuisine) located right at the entrance of the food court. They serve elevated fish tacos, ceviche, and tostadas (compared to other restaurants within the court). We only got the daily Special located on the blackboard stand: Ceviche Mixto + Ensenada Fish Tacos that came out to about $16.50 w/tax.

Quick Tips:
-Tons of parking for Mercado La Paloma.
-Tons of seating (but try to limit it to 10 people)
-Free chips and salsa
-DONT FORGET TO CHECK IN ON YELP for a free Oyster with $10 purchase
-Counter service! I also hear they have a tasting menu.
-Also don't forget to try ALL the miscellaneous hot sauces (HABANERO). Great burn, not overwhelming. On a scale of 1-Howlin'(10) they're about a 5/10.


Taste 5/5
Although the tostada is extremely thick, we really enjoyed the octopus and shrimp ceviche. The presentation is gorgeous. 4 circular dollops of avocado salsa around cubes of octopus, shrimp, and pico de gallo. Very complex flavor profiles with achiote (Yucatan cuisine!) and citrus.

Some of the best fish tacos I have ever had in my life. Lightly battered and fried, flakey fish is topped with cabbage, tomatoes, cilantro, a crema sauce, and mayo. Fresh corn tortillas. Hard to split between 10 people.

Price 5/5
2 tacos and ceviche for $16 is very reasonable.

And spiritually, after eating here, I am now found. The spot has the best seafood tacos I've ever had. The scallop, the octopus, and the battered fried fish tacos were just money. So fresh with complex, creative flavors. The Sopa de Mariscos was incredible. With every bite of this delicious stew, I was under the sea as a mermaid swimming along schools of fish and dancing crustaceans. We live in a world where hardly anything is truly fresh.

So, Holbox has been on my radar for the longest time, and I keep putting it off. Holbox is located inside La Mercado Paloma. For those who are not familiar, and from the La Mercado Paloma's website ""The area has historically suffered from disinvestment, including a lack of quality jobs and business opportunities, quality gathering spaces, quality food, and art and cultural opportunities. Over a five year period characterized by intense community engagement and research, Esperanza renovated our current building, converting it from a garment factory to a vibrant community gathering space. It is an experiment in community revitalization that provides opportunities for our local residents and showcases our local creativity to the broader Los Angeles community.""

Anyways, I digress. Chef Cetina has had 20 plus years of experience specialized in Yucatan style Mexican seafood and decided to grace us with his presence in DTLA. We came in for a tasting (that you must reserve with Holbox).

As we arrived, there were chips and salsa on the table, with Chef Cetina's hot sauces.You have been warned, the sauces range from hot and tongue scorching, but really flavorful.

The dinner menu came with 7 courses, followed by Chef Turok's mascarpone cheesecakes. If you have never tried his cheesecakes, they are best cheesecakes EVER! The cheesecakes are about $7 a slice and not part of the tasting - you won't regret ordering any of his cheesecakes. We opted for the key lime, pecan, and cream brulee. Again, I digress.

The 7 courses were: blood clams, surf clams, yellowtail ceviche, scallop aquachile, seafood soup, pan seared scallop, and wood grilled kampachi. EVERYTHING was amazing. I want to eat this every day and more.

To start, we had the blood clam and surf clam appetizer. I've had cooked blood clam before, but never had it raw. It was intense and

Next we got yellowtail ceviche. It's such a huge dish! Usually something like this is a shared plate instead of individual dish. Not that I'm complaining. We were told that it is supposed to have uni *but you know - when we came here, it was right after the SB landslides, with mud going into the ocean... so it's all good.

The scallop aquachile was really good. This was such a refreshing dish and perfect as the middle course. The avocado flower was so gorgeous and this whole dish was plated to perfection. I almost didn't want to eat this. The aquachile was a bit too spicy for me, but it was sooooo good.

After that we had the seafood soup. The broth was made with fish and shrimp shells. Pretty tasty and flavorful.

Then we had the pan seared scallop accompanied with poblano pepper, mushrooms, cream and fennel. The scallop was cooked to perfection. Overall all the ingredients meshed so well together and this I can eat all day! My favorite dish (that they serve on their menu). Because.........

The star of the night was the wood grilled kampachi. The fish was grilled and smoked whole for a family style. Tortillas were given to eat with the fish, but honestly, it wasn't necessary (is it too Asian of me to want some rice tho?). The fish was so tender. Asides from the meat around the belly area, I also asked for the fish head.

I can't wait to come back for another tasting or even lunch :) Holbox is frigging amazin! I was sooo full and this was totally worth it!",5 star rating

The seafood was so fresh and amazing.

I ordered the following for just myself and felt this was more than enough food:

1. smoked tostada: this was my favorite, it tasted so unique. I've had seafood tostadas before but nothing like this.

2. baja taco - this was also delicious

3. small mixed ceviche - loved the flavors and this was a pretty generous portion for a size small.

4. guac + chips - the guac was delicious and the chips were great, lightly salted and not overly greasy.

I think I discovered them from another LA foodie account that I follow. I was in town last weekend and knew that I had to make this my first stop from the airport. Let me tell ya, it did not disappoint.

Holbox is not a full restaurant, but rather a food stall located inside Mercado La Paloma. The Mercado was created with the mission of reinvesting in the community, which has historically suffered from divestment. There are 8-10 other food stalls inside as well, including vegetarian options.

Based off of the Yelp reviews, I ordered the uni & yellowtail ceviche. It was BOMB. I ordered the small size, but it was still a big serving. It came with a tostada that was just perfect. Everything was light, extremely fresh, and flavorful. The dish came with 4 big pieces of uni. As I always say, good uni should taste like ocean butter and this was definitely ocean buttaahhh. I ate every last piece of food on that plate.

I also asked what other dish they recommended and ordered the octopus tacos. The octopus tentacle was PERFECTLY done. Tender and not at all chewy. It's so easy to overcook octopus to the point where it's like chewing rubber. It also came with sofritas cooked in squid ink. So so so flavorful!

1) Wood grilled fish taco (4/5) - cooked perfectly and it's so soft, just melts in your mouth.
2) Octopus taco (5/5) - texture of the octopus is so chewy and bouncy. The squid ink sofrito is what sends it over the top. It's salty and sweet, and compliments everything so well.
3) Scallop taco (5/5) - wonderful flavor and so soft & bouncy! (This one's my favorite)
4) Uni ceviche (3/5) - a lot of my friends liked it, but personally wasn't the biggest fan. Although, the guacamole sauce was delicious.

http://lat.ms/2FsajXS

If you stick around to see what I have to say then I say ""YUM""

I ordered the free oyster that my Yelp check-in unlocked and enjoyed a free bag of tortilla chips.

I ordered and paid for the kampachi and uni ceviche. There is evidence of some fine knife work in the diced kampchi, tomato, and onion. Perfectly dressed/""cooked"" in lime juice. Beach fresh flavor.

Though traditional to eat the ceviche on the tostada served with the dish it seems a shame to put the delicate ceviche on the robust corn tostada. At least have a few bites straight and have one of those bites include the ceviche and uni together.

A tip is too keep the free chips you're handed when you sit down and save those as a carrier for the ceviche, they are thinner than the tostada.

We sampled several of the house made hot sauces including an Arbol peanut sauce which was tasty.

I was tempted by all of the dishes on the menu and Johnathan Gold's words will also encourage you to order more than the one dish I tried.

Chichen Itza and Holbox are fabulous food experiences but the Mercado La Paloma they are in is distractingly casual. The Mercado La Paloma also isn't next to anything making your lunch a destination lunch unless you're already visiting USC or the Exposition Blvd museums.

The Mercado La Paloma is a great social investment in the community and was opened in 1996 to generate business in this community as a plaque in the entrance explains.",4 star rating

The oyster is worth it.
And so is everything else. The Fish & Uni Ceviche is feisty and fresh, but I recommend eating the uni separately as the vinegary ceviche can overpower the more delicate flavor.
The Coctel Mixto was a gamble for me since I generally dislike tomato, but consider me a convert! It's delicious. The combo of shrimp, octopus, and oysters soaking up a refreshing sweet tomato-based soup is good enough to drink!
Tacos de Pulpo en su Tinta: messy and finger-lickin' good! That handmade corn tortilla is an accomplishment in itself, and the octopus is braised so tenderly it's a gooey melt.
We got the special of the days, a Grilled Rockfish Collar. The flesh is so delicate, and you have to dig for each bite, but all the effort is worth it!
The Scallops entree is just spectacular. The seared scallops are stunning, but that bed of roasted poblano peppers steals the show. What flavor! I can't even describe the richness of that dish!

Their ingredients were exceptionally fresh and thoughtfully combined. Every dish utilized ingredients which complimented each other in novel ways.

Furthermore, their kitchen really knows how to prepare their seafood. I've experimented with seafood cooking, and had my share of fancier seafood restaurants which ended being subpar. Cooking seafood ""just right"" is difficult to do consistently across different ingredients. This place nailed it IMHO.

Ordered the following:

- Ceviche: they used sushi-grade yellowtail sashimi as the protein rather than the conventional shrimp, resulting in a light and refreshing taste.

- Octopus Mole taco: Wow. Best thing I had that night. Octopus was cooked just right - tender but not too chewy. The lightly flavored mole was a surprisingly perfect compliment that didn't overshadow the octopus.

- Fried shrimp taco: Exceptionally plump and juicy shrimp with a crispy batter.

I loved the convenience of not having to think about what to order or even look through the menu.

The food tasted great and was very upscale. The flavors were delicately matched and very thought out. Unfortunately for me, I wasn't very hungry that evening. I wish I had gone with more of an appetite, but that was just poor timing on my part.

Big, big props to Holbox for serving an elevated version of Mexican food that is world class. Many people don't know how refined Mexican cuisine truly is.

The reason I'm giving Holbox 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt that the food and service did not really match the location.

The octopus taco, the ceviche mixto, and the shrimp torta are my favorite dishes that I order on the regular. Watching the sous chefs prepare the live urchins (humanely!) and seeing them prepare the fresh ingredients as they plate everything only adds to the familial disposition that Chef creates with his transparent style to dining.

I was initially intrigued to try this place after I saw pictures of tacos with Uni on yelp. So, I ordered the Kampachi & Uni Ceviche plate. The cashier also recommended the Mexican Ceviche and Black Squid Ink Tacos with Octopus. All the seafood served was so fresh!

The tacos were a MUST. I have never had or heard of a black Squid ink taco with octopus, but the flavor and juice that came from that dish was absolutely out of this world. I highly recommend that dish!

As for the Kampachi & Uni Ceviche plate, I thoroughly enjoyed that as well. The server brought a plate of tostadas so we can create our own tostadas with the Ceviche artistically laying on the plate. I loved how acidic the taste of this dish was-- really complemented the fish and Uni. I do think that this dish was repetitive with the Mexican Ceviche that the cashier had recommended. The difference was that the latter dish had some Squid in the ceviche. But, the flavor of the dish was basically the same so I wish I had ordered a different dish instead.

Though I've only had a few bites of their mixto and other entrees, I'd gladly vouch for their tacos. Your choice of seafood is grilled (fried fish is an option) and served with a corresponding sauce that accentuates the protein. Sure you could deep fry everything and serve it with a cup of tasty salsa, but this is just a bit better. They also hand-make their own hot sauces, if you're into that.

My only wish is that they stayed open a little later than 8:00 PM. (Chichen Itza is open until 9:00 PM, so not sure why Holbox closes earlier.)

Overall, pretty bad 48 hour experience, especially with the gaslighting and implying from gilberto that I was lying or being suspicious by wanting compensation",1 star rating

Whenever I checked Waze on the travel time, it looked like it would take an hour to get to Holbox. Around their restaurant opening, I just came back from a seafood eating extravaganza in Ensenada so I held off my visit.

The moment I was hungry and found myself in the USC area, I knew I had to visit the seafood stall. Located at the entrance at Mercado Paloma, you can't miss it once you walk in.

I asked for the recommendation and the gentleman at the register recommended the Spanish octopus tacos and said that it was his favorite dish on the menu. You get 2 tacos per order.

I sat at the counter and waited for my order. Once it arrived, it was beautifully presented. Definitely Instagrammable for those that like to share their outstanding meals.

I have a thing for house-made tortillas and their tortilla did not disappoint. I squeezed some limes over the tacos and took one bite and automatically thought was one of the best tacos I've ever tasted.

A fave of mine is the octopus taco at Petty Cash Taqueria which are the same tacos served at Tras Horizonte/Tacos Kokopelli in Tijuana. The octopus which is described on the menu to be braised and fried was perfectly cooked. The accompanying squid ink sofrito provided the base flavor that differentiated this taco from any other taco I've tasted. Normally I'm not a fan of squid ink, but the flavor in this taco was outstanding.

I can't wait to return to try other items off the menu. One of the best seafood restaurants in the city.",5 star rating

I LOVE octopus, pulpo, tako! I love it in any language and I love this taco! Rating: 4.9/5

Coktel Mixto is made with shrimp, spot prawn, octopus, oyster, avocado, house made sauce, onion, cilantro, and lime. The sauce had a great balance of sweet and spicy. It worked well with the myriad of seafood inside by bringing out the best of each ingredient. The presentation was just beautiful! Rating: 4.8/5

Scallop al Carbon is wood grilled live diver scallop served in its shell with chile X'catic sauce. The scallop was cooked very lightly so the sweetness of the scallop came through. A raw or lightly cooked/seared scallop will impart a sweetness like crab. Most of the time when a scallop is fully cooked, it will lose this delicate flavor. The chile and citrus flavors are very light and balances perfectly with the sweetness of the scallop. Perfection in half shell! Rating: 4.9/5

Chiles Rellenos de Pescado is three spicy yellow chiles stuffed with fish, breaded, fried, and served with homemade mayo and morita sauce. These rellenos are reminiscent of the American ""jalapeno popper"" but so much better. The crispy exterior contrasted the soft texture of slightly cooked fish inside. Rating: 4.3/5

Halibut Ceviche Tostada made with local line caught halibut, onion, cilantro, tomato, salsa roja, and avocado. This halibut was freshly caught from the Channel Islands. Ceviche is Yucatan's version of Hawaiian poke but instead of using shoyu, Hawaiian salt, and sesame oil, they use citrus juices, salt, onion, and cilantro. The citrus juices ""cook"" and marinate the fish. The salsa roja added some spicy notes but was balanced by the creamy avocado. The thick, crispy tostada held up to the very last bite.

2190,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Kudos to Chef Gilberto Cetina Jr., I haven't had a caliber of lunch like this in a while, and I have pretty solid lunches.

For my first time trying this little counter style restaurant inside the Mercado La Paloma complex, I wasn't sure what to expect. That all changed when my brother and I were greeted by a server with chips and salsa while we made our decision. They weren't exactly open yet, but they turned on the lights for us a little early.

I really wanted to try something with Uni, but it's currently out of season. We ended up ordering an item from each section of the menu because I really wanted to get a feel of what this place had to offer. We ordered some pata de mula (blood clams), aguachile de callo de hacha (scallops), torta de camaron (shrimp torta), and of course the tacos de pulpo en su tinta and scallop tacos.

The blood clams were prepared deliciously with garnish, not just served plain raw like most Mariscos places tend do so. The scallop aguachile was very good and acidic. I've never had scallop in this style and was pretty surprised by the fair price. Torta was probably the weakest item ordered, but only because everything else was such a hit. I would probably skip on this next time.

Now the real stars of the show are the tacos. I've heard all the rave about the octopus tacos, and the hype is real. This was probably top 3 tacos I've ever eaten, and my new favorite taco at the moment. I'm a sucker for scallops so we had to try the tacos, and they also did not disappoint. If you had to choose between the 2, I would recommend the octopus definitely.

We got free oysters for checking in on Yelp, which was a nice little ender. They offer a tasting menu at a very affordable $55 for 6 courses in the evenings. I will be sure to try this out in the near future.",5 star rating

My husband spent all day working and still decided to stop by one of my fave restaurants to get me a lobster for our romantic valentines date. Everything is going great till we open the lobster and see that it's not even fully cooked. Coming from a restaurant listed in Jonathan Golds top 100 in LA Times I would definitely expect better from a high scale seafood restaurant. This is not the first time I've received uncooked seafood. The last time I also ordered branzino and it wasn't fully cooked. This was around 2-3pm so there is no reason why the cook should have been rushed with my food.

The raw blood clams or pata de mula was tasty. It wasn't overly drenched in additional ingredients. It was simple and just perfect.

The best dish from this visit is the tacos de pulpo en su tinta or the octopus tacos. The braised octopus was tender and the squid ink sauce is an amazing burst of flavor. I had a similar taco at a past food event so thank you Holbox for making it possible to eat it again. Holbox is a lot more tastier.

2201,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"I've always been a fan of Chichen Itza, and so when I heard that Chef Gilberto Cetina was opening a seafood-oriented restaurant in the same building...let's just say I've been eagerly anticipating its arrival. Holbox is perhaps 50 feet from Chichen Itza, and almost dead ahead once you walk in the door. It has a very clean, bright design to the counter, which seats maybe 10-12, and there are plenty of tables in the environs if that's more your speed.

I went last week when they had just opened for dinner service (it was literally their first one) and then again last night. Last night was particularly special, as I brought a friend and things were a little on the quiet side, so Chef decided to create what I'd call a Yucatan-style omakase for us. While we waited for the first course, we nibbled on their delicious homemade chips and salsa. Once the food started coming out, we began with a series of raw seafood dishes. To be clear, the seafood here is just as high a quality as you'd find at one of LA's better sushi restaurants--in other words, it's super fresh and treated with great respect. Our first course was a delicious surf clam, served in the shell. Great balance of acid and just a little heat. Next came a tostada topped with white sea bass ceviche, and that was topped with impossibly fresh Santa Barbara uni. Every bite tasted of the ocean. Extraordinary. That was hard to top, but the cockteles mixto held its own. Served in a cocktail glass with a succulent shrimp hanging on to the rim and fresh seafood inside, this had tang, sweetness and a little spice. We then tried a blood clam, which was a first for both of us (you shoot it like an oyster). Again, great flavor and freshness, with just the right saucing and garnish to support the seafood but not get in the way.

The revelatory cold dishes gave way to a pair of hot ones to finish the meal. We began with ono (a white fish common to Hawaii) tacos, which were a flavorful harmony of ingredients, and finished with chile rellenos stuffed with ono, also a solid dish, though admittedly my favorites were the cold dishes, where the extraordinary seafood could take center stage as the unquestioned star.

Last week, in my inaugural visit, I tried the octopus tacos, which were perfectly cooked but a bit on the sweet side for me. I understand that they've since balanced them with a bit more heat, which was really all they needed. I also ordered the ceviche mixto, which was, like this week's cold items, incredible.

Obviously, it's not every day that the head chef personally prepares an omakase for you--my younger friend was thrilled--but it's clear that the entire staff here knows what they're doing, and that there's genuine hospitality going on. New restaurants usually take weeks--if not months--to find their legs, but while of course they're still working a few things out here and there, Holbox is already an exciting addition to LA's dining scene.",5 star rating

2205,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"I have eaten at this location about 4 times already this month alone. The owner of this location is also the owner of Chichen Itza and if you've eaten there that should tell you the quality and flavor of the food at Holbox. I had originally read about the opening of this location in LA weekly after seeing the ""opening soon"" sign at the Mercado La Paloma. I LOVE seafood so you can imagine how excited I was for this restaurant to open especially since all the seafood I've had at Chichen Itza has been amazing. So here is what I've had off the menu and what I thought:

Chiles Rellenos: it's an order of three chiles. They are yellow peppers and they are stuffed with fish. Sounds weird, but you have to try them! Such an original idea and absolutely delicious. It's only an appetizer, but I was really tempted to not share with my friends and eat all three of them.

Torta de Camaron Enpanisado: so this torta has tomatoes avocado and shrimp. The bread is so freaking good! The shrimp are breaded and fried together to form a patty. No, it's not ground shrimp or anything weird like that its whole shrimp butterflied and fried together. I almost passed on this one until I saw the owner eating one and he told me ""this is delicious and you need to try this"". I was sold and he was not lying. This torta is absolutely delicious. I would eat this every day of my life if I could (I only say this because my doctor would not be too happy with me if I did). If you are going to try anything at this location you need to try the torta, but just know that once you do you will be hooked.

Sea Bass and Black Cod Tacos: I've had both and they are both REALLY good. I can't say I liked one more than the other because that wouldn't be true. The textures and flavors make these tacos amazing. The flavor of the fish combined with the crunchiness of the cabbage and the tanginess of the crema and acidity of the tomato make this the perfect fish taco. Oh yeah I forgot to mention the tortillas are freshly made and are corn.

The Paella: I don't think I really have to say what's in a paella because ITS A PAELLA. I will say I have had my fair share of Paella and this makes my top three. It left me very satisfied.

Now some things you should know, do not expect to go in and out from here. I am leaving a very long yelp review and it's because this place is amazing. Not sure why there isn't more reviews because when I go there is always a line. They do their best to make sure you are served ASAP, but the place is not huge and space is limited. The pros outweigh the cons at this place. If you're looking for a new ""hip"" place to have seafood this is the place for you. Oh yeah all their seafood is Yucatán inspired!!!",5 star rating

-The ceviche tostada was just on point, the fish and octopus was soooo tender. Garnished with an avocado sauce, it give it the right kick. It was delightful!

-The seafood cocktail was a very unique and original. The sauce was very tasteful, unlike any other. We added blood clams and it gave it an extra kick of flavor!

- The blood clams are not very appealing, but you have to try them. They have a very peculiar flavor, hard to describe. They are very rare in Seattle, if you are not from LA, you have to try them.

Anyways, I was here a couple days ago with a few of my friends and we all agreed the ceviche mixto (rockfish, octopus, & shrimp) was one of the best dishes that night. The three of us shared a large order of the ceviche--it was sufficient, but next time I think we are just going to have our own order of ceviche because we want it all to ourselves. We also had the smoked fish tostada that came with scallops & shrimps--and that was fantastic as well. What I like about this place is that they don't skimp out on the ingredients. The amount of scallops & shrimps piled on that tostada, I was just in heaven. Lastly, we tried out the infamous taco de pulp en us tinta aka the taco with the octopus leg on it. I thought the octopus was great, it was so tender but I think the squid ink sofrito was just not happening for me (I personally don't like squid ink). Overall, the taco is def worth trying out!

The TACO DE PULPO EN SU TINTA ($6 ea.) were just OK. The octopus was cooked perfectly tender, but the ink left an aftertaste that I didn't really like with the taco.

OMG I'm coming back. Here's a finer point, the tortillas are handmade, in-house from hand-selected ingredients, and you can taste it, in every bite of taco. The whole meal from top to bottom was glorious. This vies for the best fish taco I've ever had. Also don't skip the ceviche. It's really fucking fantastic.",5 star rating
2226,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"If there's anything I know about Mexican food and cuisine are as follows: food made by the grandmothers are the best, pre-Spainard influenced dishes are must try [moles, cochinita pibil, tlyuda, insects etc], food trucks at abandoned parking lots offer some great eats and lastly, they do seafood though simply, but well. It is the reason I am at Holbox today.

Food:

Blood Clams

The Blood Clams they did it well it is just not my personal cup of tea both in terms of size and texture. Unlike the clams at typical Asian establishments, there is no sands in the Blood Clams meaning they cleaned it thoroughly [I appreciate that].

Mixed Ceviche

The mixed ceviche is great; it's the best one I have ever had. The yellowtail is soft yet there's a to the tooth firmness to its texture [meaning it's very fresh. Fish that are not fresh tends to be soft and sticks to the teeth a bit as one chews it]. The slices of octopus surprisingly, is soft and slightly firm in texture as opposed to being hard and tough like most octopuses I have eaten elsewhere. The bits of shrimp is bouncy in texture. The yellowtail, octopus and shrimp all carries a slight oceany sweetness with them at the end of each bite [very good]. I like how the fresh tomatoes, guacamole, chili and lime juice all pair and works together in accentuating the fresh and sweetness of the seafoods in the ceviche. Although the ceviche may look like a simple appetizer/dish, ensuring and successfully conveying the freshness of the ingredients to the customers' palate is very difficult. In this respect Holbox exceeded all expectations.

Price:

The price at Holbox is both reasonable and affordable considering the kinds of seafood(s) they offer as well as the quality of their freshness. What sold me is the fact their menu changes depending on the catch of the day and what they get from the fish mongers; it shows me they really care about bringing the freshest products to their patrons.

Ambiance:

Ethnic and harbors a good community-vibe all around.

For those who are a fan of seafood, definitely come and check this place out.",5 star rating

I've also had their ceviche with uni on a flat tortilla. The fish is great, the uni is fine, not worth the extra spend since the ceviche is better than the uni and solid on its own.

Also have tried the scallops. The scallops are nice, they come with avocados and a pretty spicy green sauce. Also tasty, but I still lean toward the octopus.

They've got some sauces in squeeze bars. I didn't feel the need to add them to the ceviche, but tried them on chips which was nice. The arbol guajillo was sweet and spicy. The morito was very flavorful, for lack of a better term, I'd call it dark. The kut was thicker and therefore slower to come out but spicy, I think it tasted a little habanero-y. The habanero was less spicy than expected, but had some kick obv.

All the sauces and ingredients are fresh and you can tell are very precisely prepared and thought about thoroughly before going into each dish.

1. Taco de pulpo en su tinta (Octopus Taco)

3. Wood Grilled Fish Taco
4. Baja Shrimp Taco

This is by far one of the best seafood taco places I had. Out of the 4-tacos 2-were my favorite. The Octopus Taco & Grilled Fish Taco. It tasted like nothing I had before and is unique in presentation and taste. The tortilla tasted even better and goes perfect with the Taco making it the best seafood taco. The Fried Shrimp & Scallop were okay and did not wow me as much as the Fish & Octopus.

However I will definitely come here again and try other items in the menu with my friends and family. Parking is a drag and you will need to park far to save money which is an equivalent price of 1-taco. It would be worth the walk trust me.",5 star rating

For the price, this is arguably the best quality fish taco you can get in LA. The Baja (fish) tacos are delicious, with a perfectly light and airy crunch, but still flavorful and well cooked. I also ordered the Octopus taco, which was an amazing taste profile, laying in a type of ink reduction paste which not only had great taste, it also held the octopus to the tortilla, which allowed for you to take small to mid-size bites rather than the taco falling apart after chomping into it. Last, I ordered the ceviche plate, which had a perfect pairing of acidity, salt and tangy flavor.

Last thing to mention, while I didn't want to interrupt the chef, it is mesmerizing to watch him work. He blends and purees his sauce per order ensuring that both the presentation and (more importantly) the flavor is fresh with every plate. I strongly recommend it.",4 star rating

When we arrived, we weren't greeted or acknowledged, stood there about 10 mins before someone took our order - No one was in front of us but we Let it slide since I figured they're busy bussing and preparing the food. I showed a picture of a yellowtail uni and scallop sashimi that I found here on yelp because it looked good. The owner/chef told us he could do it special for us (yay) because it's not on the menu with yellowtail sashimi and uni, I mentioned it had scallops and showed the picture once more. They said they can do it. When we got the order it was just yellowtail and uni, asked the guys nicely if there was supposed to be scallops, the worker who made it grabbed the chef who was in the kitchen, he comes out and says ""the picture you showed me is just yellowtail and uni"" I showed him the picture once more that clearly showed scallops and even said ""it's okay though.."" he abruptly said ""we did our best"" and stormed back in the kitchen as if we were annoying him.

I want to add that I'm a server, I work in the restaurant industry and customer service is very important. Given this place didn't provide much service, (you just sit where ever you like and grab your own drinks) we still tipped. It's not hard to be sympathetic or nice to make someone's experience good. If he had taken the time to apologize or even at least acknowledge the fact there was a miscommunication, it would have been okay. After all, I did say ""it's okay"" even as I questioned it because I'm a nice person and not very confrontational typically, We had wanted to order a scallop dish they have on the menu but seeing there was scallops in the picture I showed him, we passed on it. If we had known they weren't going to make it with scallops, we would have ordered more.

Anyway, my point is.... the experience left a bad taste in my mouth. No pun intended.

Another thing- we checked in to yelp for a free oyster but never received it. Didn't want to bother them for it in the end since they brushed us off and seemed so unhappy. After we asked NICELY about the scallops, we weren't acknowledged at all.

I mean, We appreciate you made us a special order but .. didn't have to be like thattttt.

Probably won't return because of the experience, the food itself was pretty good, 30 dollars for the special order that was made wrong, 14 dollars for 2 scallop tacos which were very tasty but lost my appetite on the last bite with his attitude.

EDIT: Lastly, that kind of attitude wasn't what I expected after seeing all the good reviews on here, .....especially from the owner himself! :( should've known a yelp review would be coming since I showed a picture from yelp and checked in for my free oyster ...which I never received.",1 star rating

It's a super casual vibe that belies the quality and imagination of the seafood on offer. The uni yellowtail ceviche was subtly divine.

The breading on the fish tacos were light and airy. I did find their homemade tortilla and tostada to be on the thicker side. The tostada was really hard to break/chew. However, the tortilla chips were fine. I also ordered the uni scallop. The presentation was really nice but I found it lacking some flavor. There was maybe two whole scallops in the entire dish... they were sliced into thinner pieces to serve. That was kinda pricey for what it is. Overall, it's not bad and would still go back for their other dishes.",4 star rating

Everything from the grilled octopus to the Hamachi tostada was exceptionally fresh, clean and flavorful. I found the smoked Hamachi to be so well balanced that there was never a risk its smokiness would overwhelm the delicate flavors of the scallop and shrimp. The scallop aguachile was a masterpiece in simplicity and bright tastes. The avocado and scallops were each delicate and soft while absorbing the flavors of the juices pooled below them. Don't skip the scallop taco either. It's one of the most uniquely craveable seafood tacos I've had anywhere on either side of the border.

All just a tad bit spicy for me, but so tolerable because it's delicious. I add a little more lime (I love lime, in general...) and it does the trick by curbing the heat.

Pro tip: Order the mixto ceviche if you're not sure what to order! You won't be disappointed!

Unfortunately, unless your party consists of 2 people, you'll probably have to dine outside. Most tables are set up for 2, of which there were plenty. There are signs that tables and chairs cannot be moved. Larger group tables inside were all occupied by the time we arrived. It's a food court, so no reservations taken. We took a table outside for 3 people. There are no umbrellas to provide protection from the sun. It was a bit too warm. Food was beautifully presented. However, our experience deteriorated from there. As soon as the food arrived, bees and flies swarmed our table. Leaves from trees blew into our food. Not the kind of dining experience I enjoyed after spending over $120.

The Pulpo Asado is way overpriced for the portion, all flare and limited flavor. Should spend less time decorating and focus on the flavor. The Wood Grilled Taco was good and the Scallop Taco also lacked flavor.

We ordered the yellowtail tacos and the octopus tacos cooked in its ink. Both were amazingly delicious with lots of flavor. I added a little bit of their freshly made dark chili salsa which added a little kick. We also ordered a shrimp cocktail and an octopus cocktail. The juice used in their cocktails is 99.9% similar to how they are made in the Yucatán, sweet flavor with chopped onions and avocado garnish. Mine had a whole shrimp added for presentation which you can peel and enjoy! The cocktails come with saltine crackers which is a typically condiment for the cocktail. Our drinks of choice were fresh agua de naranja which was very refreshing. Complimentary chips and fresh salsa given when we sat down at the counter.

2428,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"I made this a destination point to go and try out on a Saturday driving two and a half hrs from Bakersfield.

Was it worth it? ABSOLUTELY YES!!!

We get there and find that it's in a small food court just up the street from USC. Parking is a problem as it's an extremely tight, very compact tiny parking lot. Luckily we're able to find a spot after and sharking and making circles a few times.

Once you enter the food court, there's everything from a juice bar, Ethiopian food joint, salad, sammich etc. Holbox is in the front next to the stall selling trinkets and junk. Holbox is small, it's like a food joint you'd find in a mall food court. It's an open area with tables around other food joints. This isn't a brick and mortar stand alone restaurant.

Waited in line and got a menu at the counter. There's a few specials posted that you can choose from. The guy was very patient and helpful. Down to earth and friendly.

The food: I chose the ceviche mixto with scallop, octopus and fish taco. The meal comes with chips and salsa. The ceviche was very good. Came with one crispy fried tostada that was almost chip like. Very fresh clean ingredients. Idk what they put in that sauce, omg it's like crack. Talk about getting lost in the sauce. My mouth is watering just thinking back on this, it was that good!! The fish taco was very good. Wood grilled fish that was flaky and flavorful. The ones that blew my mind had to be the scallop and octopus tacos. Wow that first bite was bliss. Pure bliss. Foodgasm at its best. The kind that makes you throw your head back and curl your toes good. The sauce in the scallop taco was soo incredibly good I had to order two more. The scallop itself was perfectly cooked. It's like you're biting into a ball of cotton. Just one of those thing you have to try for yourself to fully understand. The octopus taco was incredible. I think the must use the ink or whatever. Seriously on par with the scallop. Very very tender octopus. Not the least bit chewy, in fact it just melts in your mouth. I'm not sure what sauce they use for it but like I said it's on par with the scallop. The chips are your normal tortilla chips, however, the salsa was amazing. Usually you see and try salsa and just say meh, it's salsa. No, not this, this was on another level. Garlicky, fresh, flavorful salsa, the kind that makes you want to drink it. Paired with that fish taco, it was absolute heaven. It's not cheap, but like I said I drove here to try this and it was absolutely worth it!!",5 star rating
2429,https://www.yelp.com/biz/holbox-los-angeles-2?osq=Restaurants,"Great food! Great price! Come try it before things really start picking up for them. All the seafood is fresh, and the flavors have great balance, just like all their food at Chichen Itza. We tried

- Ceviche Mixto
- Cocktele Mixto
- Seafood Paella
- Chile Relleno

All is a must try, but I must say, I've never had a chile relleno before with fish in it, and it was amazing. They also have four different house made condiments for you to use. Our favorite was the smoky flavored hot sauce.

Also, great service!

I visited this restaurant on the way to the coliseum for an USC game. Get off at Expo line Galen Center stop. Walk a couple of blocks to the mercado on Grand Ave. Have a great meal. Then it's on the way to the peristyle of the coliseum. You'll have a great lunch or dinner.",5 star rating

So you're not really getting a ""deal"" per se, but you do get to taste a whole range of dishes while feeling pampered by the chef, so that's pretty nice.] I I think it was my first time trying blood clams and surf clams.
