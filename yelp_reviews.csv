Every time I've had pasta here, the flavors have been unique and delicious and the pasta is very solid. The dishes are simple yet always good.

Il Giardino is located in USC Village and has indoor and outdoor seating, as well as a full menu of pasta. There are set dishes or you can build your own. They also have specials often!

If we had a decimal system, I would give this place a 4.7 stars. I'm giving this place 5 stars because this place does almost everything right. As you enter this restaurant, there's a pasta maker making fresh pasta, the menu prices are exceptionally cheap for what your getting. I got the Spaghetti Mare (Seafood pasta) for $14.99. For me the portions were perfect, but I don't eat that much. So I can see someone who has a hearty appetite being unsatisfied with the amount of food. My only complaint about my meal is the noodles were a bit on the softer side, I prefer my pasta to be al dente, however, freshly made pasta can't be made al dente (firm) due to the nature of fresh pasta. Only dry pre-packaged pasta can be made al dente, so be warned as you come here.",5 star rating

I will say there are probably better food options overall, but the price and portions here aren't bad, and there's definitely a convenience element to dining here. I also feel like it never gets super crowded here, which is definitely a plus.

I like how customizable the pastas here are, and they really do have a range of options for noodles and sauces. I just oped for the Penne Gamberi, probably out of laziness, and it was honestly pretty tasty and came with a decent amount of shrimp. My friend got the special, which was a Salmon Spaghetti. The sauce was tasty, but noodles were clearly overcooked.

The bread that the pasta comes with is really delicious and soft, and I found it was the star of the meal.",4 star rating

I usually order the pesto sauce with penne and chicken, but this time I decided to get the tagliatelle noodles. The noodles were cooked well, and the pesto sauce was fine, I just wish it was more creamy, but I guess its just how the sauce is made. The chicken was severely under seasoned, I could not make out a single flavor on it besides cooked chicken. It was slightly overcooked, but did complement the pasta quite well.

They make every order fresh and the pasta is delicious. I usually get the tagliatelle bolognese (very meaty with rich flavor) but today tried the penne gamberi (shrimp) special -- not disappointed! Comes topped with lots of shrimp cooked just right. You can substitute the pasta and add a different sauce to any of the specials. I swapped rotini and added pink sauce and it was super comforting, creamy and flavorful.

13,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-giardino-los-angeles?osq=Restaurants,"Il Giardino, situated in the USC Village, presents itself as a dining option for those seeking Italian cuisine. While the restaurant offers a pleasant ambiance and convenient location, I must admit that my dining experience left me somewhat underwhelmed.

The pasta dishes, which one would expect to be a highlight at an Italian restaurant, unfortunately fell short of expectations. The flavors were mediocre, lacking the depth and richness that can elevate a pasta dish to a memorable culinary experience. Given the lackluster taste, I couldn't help but feel that I could have easily replicated the same flavors, if not better, by preparing a homemade pasta dish using ingredients from Target or Trader Joe's.

Adding to the disappointment was the pricing. Il Giardino's menu items came with a higher price tag than what their quality warranted. It felt as though I was paying a premium for the restaurant's location rather than the excellence of the dishes themselves. This disconnect between price and quality left me feeling unsatisfied with the overall value of the dining experience.

While Il Giardino does have its merits, such as its pleasant ambiance and convenient location, I would be remiss not to mention the lackluster pasta and the relatively high prices. If you're in the USC Village area and craving Italian cuisine, it might be worth exploring other dining options or considering the possibility of creating your own pasta dish using quality ingredients from nearby stores.",3 star rating

I'll typically get a restaurant's pesto because that is my favorite. Honestly, I was underwhelmed by it. It looks beautiful, but the taste was bland :(
I felt like the sauce was very mild - not enough basil and maybe some flavor, like garlic or some salt. I liked how they oust toasted fresh pine nuts on top! I also did not really like the bread neither :/

It recently opened and replaced the previous Italian joint that had a much higher price point. Il Giardino offers make-your-own-combination pasta for around $10, which is much better than the previous place.

I stopped in over the weekend and ordered the handmade tagliatelle with Bolognese. The noodles looked more like dry, pre-made linguine, but otherwise I like how hot and tasty the food was. Temperature of my food is really important, so I appreciated how piping hot it was. It came with two small pieces of focaccia bread. The portion size was great.

26,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-giardino-los-angeles?osq=Restaurants,"Fantastic addition to USC Village! Although I don't know authentic Italian food or have tasted food in Italy, I can at least say that the pasta is truly fresh. When the restaurant just opened for a month or so, I got a chance to ask the owner how the pasta is made and it's really made fresh every day. The huge machine at the front is what they use.

I've tried practically almost all spaghetti options, and they're all great and chewy! My favorite is definitely the gnocchi (pronounces no-key). It's very soft and easy to bite into..sort of like the handmade Japanese mochi!

The sauces are also unique. Pesto isn't the usual oily pesto served at other places, but it has creamy texture instead. The mushroom sauce was quite different from what I expected since the mushrooms themselves have a very deep, earthy taste to them. Personally, it's not to my liking but perhaps others will favor them. Lastly, the Bolognese isn't bitter as the previous pasta place has made them to be. Hooray!

If you want the full set, spaghetti with protein, then it will cost about ~$15 pretax. I did order the chicken once and it was quite a small fillet for an additional $4.

And each spaghetti comes up with two slices of fresh bread! Happy hour 20% from 3-5pm is available!",4 star rating

This place is a greta option if you're nearby the village, and you want pasta. It's definitely better than the other Italian restaurants close to USC's campus, so I definitely recommend this restaurant.

I ordered from here quite often during the pandemic, but to be honest, I expected mediocre pasta at best. Usc's campus doesn't have a lot of great options, so my expectations were low. However, this place surprised me! It was actually very good! I have had the pesto, the bolognese, and the truffle pasta. They were all delicious! I like that they're not to heavy and they taste freshly made. They're definitely not gourmet or anything unique, but they keep it simple and they make a good standard pasta.

They have a super cool glass screen which allows you to see the pasta maker wheeling out fresh pasta, the cooks sautéing and grilling the meats and sauces. It was a vibe forsure.

They have pastas, salads, and sandwiches and the crowd in the restaurant looked like they were eating on all types of it so that reassured me that everything they were cooking was poppin! (Majority USC students/staff)

I had the pleasure of being helped by the manager who was so nice and happy to greet and assist a new customer. With his expertise choice from what my favorite things were; I got the fresh rigatoni with arrabbiata sauce and added a touch of cream (aka spicy pink sauce lol) and sautéed mushrooms.

Sure it's not a fancy Italian restaurant serving pasta for over $16, but it is comparable with the pricing being around $10. There are different combinations you could order. They have a variety of pasta and sauce options. I got the tagliatelle bolognese to-go and was surprised with the amount of pasta that was inside. Two small pieces of bread came with the meal as well. The bread was a little odd and had a strangely bright yellow color to it and had the consistency of a cake. Apparently, the pasta is made fresh every day and I do believe that. The tagliatelle I ordered had the consistency and look of what fresh pasta should be. I was very impressed, because fresh pasta is usually very costly, but this place manages to serve up a big portion for a fraction of the usual cost of fresh pasta at a fancy Italian place. The bolognese sauce was tasty, but the more I ate of it, the less flavor it seemed to have. Overall, this place is great to satisfy your pasta cravings.",4 star rating
57,https://www.yelp.com/biz/il-giardino-los-angeles?osq=Restaurants,Amazing Italian food. I was on the campus and in the mood for pasta. I was lucky enough to come across this place. Exquisite quality. Service was fast & staff was friendly. Also I found out that the pasta is home made. They make it at the restaurant and the price is hard to beat. If you want to have the same meal somewhere else expect to pay triple the price. The ambience is casual and the deco gives the vibe that you are in a fine dining. You can pick your pasta with different sauces. I tried the fettuccine Alfredo mushroom and it is to die for. It's a must! I wish I had the stomach to try the rest of the menu. Also try the tiramisu ( also home made ) park in the parking structure and they validate 2 hours for free.,5 star rating

My Order: penne pasta with arriabiata sauce.

Environment: former location of Badillo pasta, the layout is exactly the same with just a little different aesthetics and food options.

Verdict: better than Barilla (that was there before). It serves up a nice bowl of hot made to order pasta that comes with two slices of bread. It is filling and delicious

How to Get More Stars: offer more vegetarian options (ie veggies for pasta, etc).

Next Time: try the different types of pasta.",3 star rating

I have to be honest and say that I was underwhelmed by the pesto sauce and enjoyed my friends Rigatoni more than my own order.

I got there first and stood behind 2 empty bar seats with an empty drink and fries on the counter. After standing there looking at the bartenders for over 5 minutes, I asked if the seats were taken, he said no and removed the drink and fries. Unfortunately, he did not wipe down the obvious dirty countertop, so I got a napkin. While it was busy, he didn't say a word to me and I waited another 5 minutes before he asked what I wanted. I ordered a glass of wine and told him a friend would be joining me and we needed two sperate checks, he understood. Another bartender took over for him when my friend arrived and she handed over her card and ordered a drink. We had to flag the bartender to over to order. The food arrived which was edible but nothing to write home about, she had a patty melt and I had a burger, fries were extra $. When we got the bill, he had put the entire food order on her card. Given what I had already seen from the folks working, I gave my friend cash to save time.
We went to the Shrine but left early and came back for one final drink. It was not busy and we sat at the end of the bar. Both bartenders were at the other other end chatting away with friends so we had to flag them down for a drink. After 20 minutes we were ready to leave, I saw our bartender and raised my hand and gave the check motion. I know he saw me as he nodded and walked to the register. He then made some drinks and went back to talking with his pals at the end of the bar. Again, we had to flag down the other bartender to get the bill.
Needless to say, the service was very bad, but I still gave a %20 tip each time.
I get that this is a college bar, and maybe the clientele doesn't care about dirty counters or lousy service, but I do.

It was busy and loud inside the restaurant but service was quick and easy with the QR code ordering system. The outside seating area is less chaotic.

The fried pickles are super crispy and come battered quite well so they can be a really nice appetizer for a small table group. I am a huge fan of the variety with the cocktails, especially the mule variations they offer, where they have 3 separate flavors.

The service can be slow. I tried to join the waitlist online and a manager said I couldn't even though it was as I was walking to their place. They said you can only join the waitlist in person, and if the whole party is there which seems a little unreasonable. Other than that, you order on your own time and the bar is open seating so there usually somewhere to sit regardless.",4 star rating

It was also fairly quiet with the exception of the variety of games playing on the tvs. We were quickly seated and we just wanted to orders appetizers. We used the QR ordering system which was simple and convenient. The food came quickly. I ordered the calamari and shrimp, my fiancé ordered the loaded tots.

When all the food arrived it looked and tasted great. The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is there were small flies/gnats that descended upon the table once the food came. I was really caught off guard by it and there was really no escaping them. I used the electronic fan in my purse and they flew past them. I moved tables and they followed us, not surprisingly. I eventually had to just ask for a box and decided to enjoy my food at home in an environment free of interruption.

I don't know what the gnat situation is about but the staff were absolutely clueless as to the fact that it was occurring.

You would think, in LA, out of all cities, and at a place that's labeled as a sports bar, that they will ensure there are different sports and games playing on dozens of TVs they have; BUT that sure wasn't the case. They only had one NBA game playing on ALL their TVs because none of the other channels with other games were working and upon speaking with the manager, she refused to stream the game from my friend's phone that would have allowed us to watch it on at least one of their TVs.

Our waitress was really nice, but my drink took entirely too long, about 10-15 minutes, because they didn't have a clean martini glass at the time. Needless to say, manager could care less about this or the fact that we came there to watch the Lakers game and ordered a bunch of food, just to leave once the managers literally said ""no"" and walked away without any explanation or discussion.

After eating here yesterday during the 4-6 PM Happy Hour and being incredibly satisfied with the HH Nashville Hot Chicken Sandwich, I came here again during Happy Hour to try the HH Smash Burger.

You're also able to order wings for $1.50 each and I was intrigued by the unique ""Black Garlic Mango Habanero"" flavor available, so I decided to try one single wing with that flavor.

The HH Smash Burger was very good. If I ordered it again, I would probably ask for no mustard though. I also forget to put the ranch I had on the side on it and I'm sure that would've really upped the flavor, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. The single wing did not disappoint either! The very unique flavor was incredibly tasty and I'll probably be ordering more than one next time.

We came in for lunch a Monday and were seated in a high top table. We are of regular height and the table and chair height did not match, meaning you can't scoot all the way in. Not that big of a deal. Someone in our party headed to the bathroom before we ordered and came back to say there was not one cover or any toilet paper in any single stall. Eeek, they were not busy at all- she had to let them know.

You can order off the app by using the QR codes on the table. We got water for the entire table and a few sodas and an Arnold Palmer. I had to send it back, it was warm and lacked the normal flavor. She replaced it with a sprite.

They were out of several menu items, but the nice thing is that it shows on the app that it's out of stock. We ordered the salmon, Mac and cheese, honey chicken burger and a wrap. The burger came with fries (I upgraded to truffle fries) which were really good and I would recommend. The burger was pretty tasty as well. The salmon was just decent along with the Mac and cheese. The wrap was pretty good.

Our server did not refill our drinks despite being asked for refills. I don't think I would return as the overall service was really bad.

Woman comes up to him and tells him he needs a reservation so they walk back to the stand. She gets his info, says a table is open and walks him straight back to the table he was at 2 minutes ago. He had been there 3 times prior to this and never had to go through that process which is why he just sat in the bar area at an open table top initially.

Since he arrived before me, he sent the link for our table to request a drink ahead while we walked from a parking structure. It took 22 minutes to get 1 drink. Pretty insane to me when it wasn't very packed there.

Also, we had a little accident where a side of ranch got knocked on the floor. I told the security guard so we could get someone over. He pointed me to used rags in a red bucket near him. Pretty nasty in my opinion. I was hoping he could get someone with a mop because ranch is oily which means the floor is very slick and didn't want someone to slip on it but I guess ""security"" doesn't mean to secure the area when people can fall easily. Eventually, we had a very nice lady came to help us out. She was an ACE. Guy was kind of useless. Our experience here was just weird from the reservation to the girl who couldn't be bothered about our drink status to the security.

That does speak to the food that RnR's has been able to sustain itself with takeout orders. The food, in my experience, has been solid, but not spectacular. The fish and chips are exactly what you can expect from a Irish-themed bar, and the Hot Chicken Sando is fine, if not punishing enough for you heat-seekers.

The waitstaff is earnest and attentive, especially given how often they have been overutilized in dealing with (generally!) a relatively unforgiving younger college clientele. The bathrooms are usually clean and I think I espied a shuffleboard in the lobby for those of you who like games.

The restaurant's setting is a mix of modern eclectic man cave focusing on the bar and several tv monitors to view sports, ie USC football and all other fun sports related news.

Service was cordial nice and friendly by the hostesses, waitress and servers. But service was extra nice when some of the staff recognized me from my visits at the WeHo location.

Not a big fan of pub food, and there were some different healthy items on the menu offering vegan options. So I ordered the thin soba noodles and the Reilly's hot crispy chicken sandwich and a glass iced tea. Soba noodles looked unimpressive, bland and tasted blah. Lacked flavor in every way, sent it back, rejected! The crisp spicy chicken sandwich was just okay, it would really come in 3rd place/show, compared to others. Was only able to eat half :( The iced tea was my only salvation, and I upgraded to a glass of Rosé, complements of a gentleman admirer sitting at the bar lounge.

He later introduced himself, although I was reluctant to socialize, he was nice and turned out to be in upper management for the USC village.
Pretty soon restaurant staff joined in our conversation, which became a business network talk and we all exchanged contact info for future biz, therefore a worthwhile productive visit here.

160,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rock-and-reillys-usc-village-los-angeles,"Summary: They've got good burgers! Avoid the salad unless you want it as an appetizer (if you tend to eat a lot that is). Good service overall!

Recently came on a weekday for lunch slightly past 11am and the place was not packed at all. The crowd started coming after noon.

Ordered the Irish Burger (4.5/5): For under $10, I'd say this burger is probably the best in USC Village. They give you two patties (from grass fed cows) and they're so juicy and tender! The fried pickles actually did not disturb me and I ate the burger with them inside. The potato buns weren't mushy towards the end unlike other restaurants. No sides except for a slice of pickled cucumber.

Celtic Caesar Salad with extra side of grilled Chicken (2/5): I ordered this to go. Really disappointed in how expensive the salad was. It was $11.75 for the salad and $4 for the extra chicken. The salad did not fill up the entire bowl and the chicken was also small in portion size. The salad dressing was very sour. I did like how they smashed up the croutons into tiny pieces.

Came again for happy hour and only the All American Burger (3.5/5) was on the happy hour menu for $6.75. Again, it's a good burger but I felt like I was eating the hamburger version of a typical hotdog with the ketchup and mustard. It's not my taste, but maybe others will like it.

Fried sweet potato fries (4/5): Decent. Lightly salted so the seasoning wasn't overpowering. The sweet potatoes weren't soggy so they were crisp but soft on the inside. They don't give you a whole lot of fries but it's a good portion.

Our server Michael was fantastic. This is my first time actually wanting to know the server's name because my friend and I appreciated his service. He was professional without being pushy and he kindly split our bill already for us.",4 star rating

I spoke with three different servers to ask where they were and each just told me the kitchen was busy. The last conversation I asked the server to refund our order and he told me he would.

Since we only get an hour for lunch we had to ask for a box to go. The waitress was a little short with me when I asked for the boxes. She looked a little frazzled, I'm guessing they were short staffed. On top of all that my salad was not what I ordered so I was stuck taking an overpriced Caesar back to the office.

We sat in the back area where there is comfortable seating. I really enjoyed that they had card games to play with the group. They have vegetarian options for food, which was convenient.

The second time I visited i sat at the bar and came for happy hour. They have 5 dollar wine, drafts and mixed drinks which was awesome! They also have a happy hour for food.

I'm giving a one star because of the horrible service we had. In my opinion great service is one of the elements that creates a great experience. We were one of the first party of four to walk into the restaurant (it was empty at this point). You don't have to order with anyone, everything is done on the QR code, you pay, tip and food is brought to you. The food comes out and our waitress asks if we wanted anything else, I asked for ranch, she brings it, my friend asks for tartar sauce she brings it out, after a good while of eating my other friend asked her for ranch. Waitress brings the ranch and with a rude tone looks at us upset and asks ""let me know right now what else you want, is that all, are you going to ask for more let me know now?"" Mind you it was empty in there with a small amount of people. At that point we felt like we could not ask for anything else, otherwise, we were going to get attitude back. I've worked at a restaurant for years as a waitress and being a waitress means making sure our guests our happy from beginning to end. We were never rude about what we requested, but after that, we just didn't feel as happy as the way we walked in.

We came at 5pm on a Friday when few people were here, but it took a while to get the hostess' attention. She finally sat us at a dirty table with shot glasses and limes everywhere. The servers pulled the dishes off as we sat down, but never came back to wipe down the table which had a lot of crumbs (ew). After ordering, it took over half an hour to get our food. It was weird considering how early it was for dinner/drinks and how basic our orders were.

My friend ordered a reuben sandwich which she said was pretty great. I ordered a chicken ""quickwich"" off the happy hour menu (with black garlic honey habanero sauce) plus a side of fries. The sandwich was tasty, but literally consisted of a few small pieces of boneless wings + a bit of ranch on top slapped between store bought potato buns. The fries were ok, but tasted like the ones pulled out of a frozen bag that you would get with a Wolfgang Puck-type airport meal. Rock and Reilly's used to have potato wedges here which were really good and are now unfortunately off the menu.

I sat at the bar that wraps around multiple televisions for your sports watching pleasure. The prices here are affordable to Los Angeles Standards with a cocktail running you from $8-$11 on average, on-draft pints run you $5-10, and they have a decent selection of wine if you are trying to go fancy.

My bartender Hailey was engaging with a great smile. She was able to hold up conversation and keep up with the orders coming her way. Haley was super professional and very social with customers. What I learned was she is a screen writer who writes scripts, which is super rad. Always nice to have creative people working in your establishment looking to seek more in their life! As for the service she was quick to ask me if I wanted another beer and was great with making suggestions.

As for the food, I ordered the Reilly's Hot Chicken which absolutely delicious! The fried chicken was not overly breaded and the chicken was of good quality. I do want to alert you that it gets messy when eating. As for looking at other menu options they have burgers, sandwiches, Irish pub food (shepherds pie, Irish nachos, and a Mac and cheese with an Irish twist). The food jeered is super affordable with burgers/sandwiches starting at $8.75.

For parking I would recommend parking on 28th street or 30th street (free parking) and walking over instead of paying at the Village parking structure.

Overall, this establishment is a good place to grab a bite to eat, have a few drinks and enjoy an inviting vibe with great service!

182,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rock-and-reillys-usc-village-los-angeles,"Thoroughly unimpressed with this new establishment in the USC Village. USC seems to do a very good job of continually disappointing me with the choices that it makes for the establishments in its relatively new village.

The food here is fine. And by fine, I mean it's good junk food to gorge yourself with if you're drunk off of their mediocre alcoholic beverages and can't actually taste it. Otherwise, it tastes like pure greasy garbage. But the negatives don't end there!

The service here is absolutely terrible. First of all, every time I have gone, I have had to wait excruciatingly long amounts of time to get anything done. Two other customers in the restaurant? Doesn't matter, they'll get to you in about an hour. Literally. We wait forever just to have our order taken, and then it literally takes over an hour to actually get the food served to us. I have been here a few times now, and every time I end up having to wait a ridiculously long amount of time for simple menu items that I ordered. They must've forgotten it, because after inquiring the third time about my food, they finally started to MAKE it. I have classes, work, and places to be. For a location by a university, it's all the more unacceptable to be operating at such a lackluster and slow pace.

Tonight was just the icing on the cake, and an example of blatant discrimination. The girl in front of us LITERALLY had an expired driver's license, but they still let her in. Here comes us next, however, and my friend, who has a temporary ID currently, and also brought photo IDs, a photo of his old driver's license, AND voter registration to prove his identity, was denied. Never before have I seen such a blatant example of selective bias right before my eyes.

This place was already thoroughly unimpressive to me. Tonight just settled for me, and I definitely won't be interested in returning.

So when I found out that they were opening at the USC Village, I couldn't wait! The opening has been delayed for some time but it's finally slated for late October 2018.

Rock & Reilly's is the perfect addition to the USC campus area because we all know that 901 Bar and Grill can't fit everyone! Anchoring the USC Village Hoover St. entrance, R&R is a spacious, modern Irish pub.

I had the pleasure of attending their preview event earlier this evening. Upon arrival, we were greeted with high fives from the hostess. Throughout the two hour event, we had the opportunity to sample light bites, cocktails, beers on tap, and wine.

Light Bites
+ Tater tots
+ Potato wedges
+ Bacon, lettuce, tomato skewer
+ Buffalo chicken tender
+ Chicken with peanut sauce

While the light bites didn't feature their signature and most popular dishes, they were seasoned well and perfect with the drinks. However, their tater tots are always crispy and delicious!

Cocktails
- Reilly's Smash
- Dublin 12

Both these cocktails were sweeten with Trader Joe's Raw Blue Agave. The Rielly's Mother's Milk Whiskey didn't get to shine through with the agave and juices. At the end of the night, we just asked for the whiskey neat.

Wine
- Pinot Noir Rosé (Ryder Estate)

Do not get this rosé!! The nose notes were super unappealing. We thought it was an isolated issue for that bottle. Another bottle was opened - same issue! The bartender said it could be the temperature of the wine. Seemed spoiled to me...

Beers on Tap
+ Samuel Adams Octoberfest
+ Angry Orchard Rose

Both beers that I had were seasonal. Once they get settled in, the beers on tap will be rotated occasionally. Currently, they offer around 10 - 12 different beers on tap such as Iron Triangle IPA and Coors Lite.

Overall, there are plenty of screens for game day and sports viewing. There is a max capacity sign of 138. Seating is limited but very spacious to stand around. Also, there is a private room for large groups.

After about 15 minutes, we got the attention of when of the male waiters at the restaurant. We asked, ""If we could give our orders now?"" He didn't even respond to my friend, he turned away and walked to another waitress. The other waitress came and told us that we needed to move because this room was closed. We told her that the hostess sat us here. She then nodded her head and said that we still aren't allowed to sit here, but she would go talk to the hostess.

She came back later and said, ""You will have to move. This area is closed. We aren't allowed to work overtime- legally in order to help you."" She didn't offer to solve the problem that her team had created. She just basically said, ""get out.""

Then she cane over to our friend and told us that her grandma died so my friend shouldn't say mean things to her!!!! They really need to provide better mental health support for their staff cuz it sounds like she was really going through it. Probably won't ever come back here. Go to the 9-0 or traddies instead!

In what world is this excusable? But the bartender with the wavy dark hair has the nerve to get sassy with me because it wasn't *his* mistake. Rather than rectifying the situation by APOLOGIZING, he gets pissy that I'm expressing my discontent. Are you serious? Grow up and learn how to handle mistakes your team made. What makes this situation even worse, is that they decided to add more tip which they didn't even deserve in the first place. UNSCRUPULOUS ESTABLISHMENT and absolutely unacceptable.

Came here with a friend to catch up while on the USC campus around 6:30. It took a bit of time to get seated. The waitstaff was pleasant but inattentive and disorganized. Three different people saw us standing at the host table and said they would help us get seated but it was the original hostess who eventually got us seated. We chose to sit outside as there was a student networking event going on and it's loud inside. The outside patio is a nice area and much easier to chat. It took about 20 minutes for the food to come out and I got the fish and chips (~$16). The fries were nice and crispy and there were three thin pieces of fish. It was hot but the fish was a tad soggy. The tartar sauce that accompanied it on the side was good. My friend got the vegan burger and she mentioned getting it each time she goes there. They bring out a water jug so you have water available. Overall food quality was decent but it's overpriced and service is disorganized.,3 star rating

We tried to move to another table that our waitress told us was okay, but as we were moving, another group took that table so I'm not quite sure what happened, but we ended up with the initial table...as our meal progressed, it got increasingly hot and sunny to the point that some of us were sweating and uncomfortable, which is not ideal for dining indoors. If I come back, I'll make sure to get a table inside away from the window.

This place took a little while to open so I was excited when it finally did. The space is modern and hip, I like it. I even saw a private room in that back, which would be great for lunch meetings and events. I also did not realize that this was a chain as I saw another location in downtown LA the other day.

The big disappointment for me with the food, which is the main reason that we're here...I do like that they have a vegan side of the menu that has the same offerings as their regular menu, I've never seen that before. I ordered the dirty Irish burger and the truffle fries (because the burgers don't come with fries...which honestly kind of sucks, I mean come on, just charge a couple extra dollars and include some fries please). The waitress did not ask me how I wanted my burger cooked which was odd so I asked her how they cook their burgers and she said they cook them all medium well but it won't be dry, and that's exactly how I like it so I thought perfect, but I was wrong... the burger was basically burnt and dry...I did not feel like complaining and just ate what I could. Everything else but the patty was good including the bun, the cheese, the fried onion but the burger was almost inedible. The truffle fries were just okay. I tried the fish and chips, which looked impressive but when I had a piece of fish, it was mainly batter. The chicken sandwich looked good, but I didn't get to try it.

We told the server before sitting down that it was my friend's birthday and it was nice they came out to sing happy birthday and gave her a mini cookie pazookie birthday cake. However, when we were paying the check, we noticed that they added the cookie to the bill which was a head scratcher to me.

The beer selection is decent not as expansive as I thought but had something for everyone! Wish they'd have more than just the names of the beer on the menus. A little blurb about what type of beer it is would've been nice.
This is where the rude bartender comes in play. Didn't even wanna let me taste any of the beers and when I finally pressed he let me taste one. Just a sip which was all foam anyway.

He didn't even smile once like cmon you work at a restaurant/bar. I have in the past too. You have to smile.

I am typically fair with my reviews and often see the light that makes a place worthwhile. I supposed my presumptive notions are what excited me too much for this place. What's there to hate? An Irish bar with a selections of local and foreign draft beers, bar food, and a great location. It was perfect... in theory.

We came as a group to celebrate a birthday. We were unsure how many people were going to be in attendance so we tried to approximate. It was a fairly accurate guest; asking for a table that could fit 9 though there was 11 of us that came. Instead of being accommodated, we were given a not so pleasant attitude.

Maybe it was a combination of a Saturday, March madness, and the location but the way we were waited was poor. The drinks took a while to be served, the food even longer, and the plenty of mistakes. As much as I don't want to berate their service, it simply is the truth.

It was more upscale than your typical pub, yet unpretentious and inviting. I found that the price point of the food was fair and justified considering where it's located, which is a major plus. Parking was easy. I just parked in the Village Structure and had a short and scenic walk to the restaurant. They also validate for 3 hours, which is nice!
This is not Spago and it's not located in Barstow. Don't come here expecting Spago like dishes and expect to pay Del Taco like prices. It's wise to be realistic with your expectations in any establishment you visit. This is an upscale pub that serves tasty food, consistent with the kind of restaurant it is. It's definitely a place worth visiting especially when you're in the neighborhood.",5 star rating

255,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rock-and-reillys-usc-village-los-angeles,"I have been to Rock and Reilly's a couple of times and I honestly really want to like this place. However, the past couple of times I have been here there has always been something wrong and the ways that they fix these wrongs have been shaky.

The first time I went here was a few months ago. I wanted to order some burgers and veggies to go. Upon arrival, I was told that they were out of veggies and that they were going to comp our item. However, I feel like the employee didn't know what comping an item means, because I was still charged for my replacement item (which I think was fries or something). I think the employee meant that she was going to ""comp"" our veggies, but you can't comp an item that I never received. Regardless, we later discovered while driving that the burgers we received were good, but did not have the special customizations that we had initially ordered (no cheese).

The second time I came here I ordered the Californian burger to be eaten in house with truffle fries. The truffle fries were excellent which was nice. However, the burger I received was EXTREMELY salty on the bottom bun. I'm not a picky eater whatsoever but oh my god that was pretty inedible. I notified a staff member who gladly replaced it and she told me that the burger was going to be comped. After receiving my replacement burger, I anticipated that this new burger (which was a bit dry, but I didn't want to make this a big deal) would come at no cost. However, when we received our bill we were still charged for the burger and was told that our previous burger was comp-ed. I'm assuming that the waitress meant that she ""comped"" the really salty burger that was messed up. However, you literally can't ""comp"" a messed up item as it is essentially considered a non-item. In other words, by ""comping"" the problem burger they are essentially providing me a free messed up burger which doesn't make any sense. For my burger to be truly comped, the replacement burger should come at no charge. I was kind of annoyed at this fact, but the waitress was nice so I just let it be.

In other words, to comp -
1. The problem item is voided from the tab
2. The replacement for the problem item is provided without charge

Overall, I think that the customer service here is good in the sense that they are attentive to your issues and will attempt to fix them. However, with that being said the execution is poor in that the method in which they fix customer feedback is not correct.",2 star rating

271,https://www.yelp.com/biz/rock-and-reillys-usc-village-los-angeles,"My husband and I (both Asian Americans) experienced our first racial discrimination treatment at this restaurant for the first time since we moved to the US 29 years ago (20 in LA). Yesterday (2/26), we arrived too early for our concert at the nearby Shrine Auditorium and decided to have a drink. Rock & Reiley's in the USC Village seemed like a good choice with a proper bar and not too crowded, so we lined up after 4 people. The guy at the outdoor gate checked the phones of the people before us (presumably showing vaccination records) and let them in. Then he immediately turned his back on us. (He definitely saw us when he waved the people in.) I waited about 10 secs, pulled up my vaccination record, walked up, showed him my digital vaccination record, and said ""Excuse me, sir. There are two of us."" He looked at me and said there was a wait. I asked how long the wait would be, and he said 10 minutes (without looking around at all) and turned away again. I told my husband that we should go because we didn't have that much time to wait, but he hesitated because the Chinese Restaurant we just dined at didn't serve alcohol and he really wanted a drink before the concert. So I called out to the guy again and said that we were going to the concert and didn't have much time. I asked him whether there really was a 10-min wait because the bar inside didn't seem that busy and there were a few empty outdoor tables in the patio. He again said yes without a beat and turned away again. By now, I was angry because his attitude was rude and beyond obvious. He could have fed me something like we have space limitation due to Covid, or the wait is hard to predict, or you can get in as soon as 2 people leave, etc. But no, his attitude said ""go away"" loud and clear! There were a 2-3 others lined up behind us at this time, so my husband and I left. As we waited at the crosswalk (about 50 feet away) for the light, I turned back and was surprised to see no more line there. (They didn't leave because I'd have seen the guy in a very obvious checker jacket behind us nearby.) Even worse, 2 middle-aged white guys walked up right while I was watching and the guy let them in with a quick peek at the phone. And then he did the same with another white guy shortly after. This all happened within the few minutes we were waiting for the light to change! My husband and I were shocked and in disbelief. I thought of walking back to confront him, but decided not to bother. He clearly doesn't want our business, then why would I want to give him business? I am glad that we didn't, because we ended up avoiding a long line to get into Shrine Auditorium and had three nice and relaxing drinks in a beautiful setting before the concert. Nevertheless, I want to write a review to let other Asians or Asian Americans know of our treatment there. USC is one of the most diverse communities in LA, and I'd expect a business serving that community to do better with I&D not worse.",1 star rating

I literally yelled and tried to flag down one server and she didn't notice me. I succeeded with the same tactic with the next server. She told us that section was reserved for a Bumble event. No one told us this and this section was not marked off. But I would also assume that those patrons would want to eat so why not offer us menus anyways? Nonetheless, we decided to sit out on the patio. It takes another 20 minutes for someone to bring us menus and take our orders. We ordered drinks, 2 burgers, and fries to share. The drinks took at least 15 min and the burgers another 20. The fries NEVER came. We finished our food and sat there talking for at least 30 min and our server, CJ, never came back. We went to the register to pay for our bill and I handed her my validation ticket for parking. She handed everything back to us. When I inserted my ticket at the machine downstairs, it said I owed $15, which basically meant she didn't validate it. I had also asked my friend if he checked his receipt since they probably charged us for the fries we never got and he said he forgot to check. I went to Trader Joe's and got it validated there. Third time isn't the charm in this case and I don't think I'll be going back.",1 star rating

When it first opened, the food was so much better. It's pretty obvious that the ""fish"" from the fish and chips"" are gardein's fish sticks. If I wanted that I could make it at home. Disappointing.

I ordered a single appetizer and that was it, but I had to remind the waitress 3 times over the span of a literal hour about our order. My friend even had to leave early for an event that we thought we wouldn't have to worry about. An hour for an appetizer is ridiculous, especially when you consider how egregiously over staffed this place is. There are girls fumbling back and forth from the kitchen, carrying nothing and just standing in groups doing everything but waiting tables. The place was practically empty when we were there but there were at least 15+ employees who could've helped. I even saw another table get our exact appetizer that we ordered, only for ours to follow a whole half hour from theirs. Extremely disappointed in this lackluster service.

The staff-
My boyfriend, a friend and I all came in to watch the National Football Championship and ( with a COMPLETELY EMPTY BAR BESIDES US) asked if they could turn the volume up until the MMA fight began. The staff , a bartender named Ash & and a dark-haired male manager who would never give us his name, berated my boyfriend and friend , saying that they were ""rude guys "" for asking and ""who even cares about that game?? We ONLY play the sound for MMA fights!""
Please please train your staff to make drinks!!! I had to explain step-by-step to the dark-haired male manager how to make an extremely common shot..... seven times :0

Our server went on break halfway through our meal and the person who was supposed to take over was MUCH more interested in her tables outside. We saw her once. Had to ask for our check and another server had to ring us up. Fine, not a huge deal, just disappointing. The kicker was that I asked to have my parking validated and the server waived it under a scanner and handed it back. As we left the garage we had to pay $20 to get out because she failed to actually validate the ticket. So our lunch ended up being way too expensive.

Truffle fries were good, but they looked and tasted exactly the same as some truffle fries my friends brought me from a KBBQ place in Venice Beach... so I guess I'd just call them your typical truffle fries. The truffle burger with a potato bun was excellent -- very juicy and flavorful. The pricing of the burgers was also very reasonable for full service, though the grilled cheese/tomato bisque seemed rather overpriced ($12.75 without tax or tip). The restaurant looks great inside and out (which it should, I guess, seeing as it took them over a year to be ready to open in this space). If I want a burger, I'll definitely go here instead of Wahlburgers in the Village. I'm not sure if they have takeout. But they do have a plant-based version of their regular menu, which is very cool!

Let me start out by staying our waitress was great-the obvious problem was with management. We got in at about 8:20 on a Wednesday and were put on a waitlist for a table, which is not a problem at all since it was busy! We were told we could start at the bar and that our order would be transferred to our table. We ordered drinks and a starter which we didn't end up getting until almost an hour after we had ordered it and only after my boyfriend went to ask. Turns out it had been sitting behind the bar and had gone cold. Then our meal, which was small and overpriced, took another half hour and even then we didn't get everything we had ordered delivered to our table, so we had to ask the poor waitress who was already running around like crazy to take it off our bill so we could finally go home. We were told they were understaffed in the kitchen which by the looks of other reviews seems to be an issue here. Please warn customers of this either beforehand or during their wait. It was frustrating watching other customers who had arrived after us receive their food before we even got our starter.

The buffalo cauliflower we ordered as an appetizer was good. I was going to order a burger but the waitress came and told us about the specials-brick chicken and salmon. I was hesitant to order the salmon but the way the waitress described it sounded good and my daughter encouraged me to try it. I thought it was a healthier option even though it was much more expensive than the burger. Then I took one bite of the salmon and thought it was incredibly salty- almost inedible. And whatever couscous dish was under it WAS inedible to me. I was with my daughter and her boyfriend and didn't want to make an issue out of it. When the waitress came out I asked if it was fresh or frozen because it just wasn't good. My daughter's chicken was good but she didn't touch the unfriendly vegetables. I wish there had been any other options even like just broccoli. Her boyfriend liked his fish and chips. The manager asked me if I wanted another piece of fish but NO! I could barely stomach the first. He basically said ok and walked away. So I will not be taking my USC student here again- no matter how convenient. Also, they did not offer us a dessert menu- I thought the kids might want some but I assumed there wasn't one. There was no offer for compensation-offer of a drink or dessert - nothing- just - oh sorry.

Their menu isn't even really study food geared. They have one iced coffee option, no study snacks like fruit or granola bars. Breakfast is only served Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for limited hours. I came in today thinking just a nice yogurt and fruit would do to energize me for my day of studying but they said they don't do breakfast. There were no other options offered. I had to settle for a super greasy mushroom flatbread that I blotted down with napkins. The food is also very pricey for what you get. My boyfriend got three baby sliders and thick fries for 12 bucks. One mini mexican burger from tacos el unico is literally a dollar and the same size.

So far, the waitress has come by a grand total of once and our leftover food has been sitting here for near an hour while we study.

Although we uber-ed there, it seemed like parking was a little hard to find around the area, and the fact that there were security guards at ever block kind of worried me a little as well.

The food that we ordered, the oxtail fries and mac and cheese were both not bad, but they were much pricier than I expected/thought they would be, and honestly if they didn't end up lasting me 2-3 meals, I definitely would have been more upset at how much they cost.

I'm quickly becoming a regular here, and I've tried a decent chunk of the menu, but my go-tos are the A&C (even better if you ask for them to add chicken) and Greek salads.

Would Recommend? - Absolutely not. I would recommend against going here.

What makes a great dining experience? According to the BBC, it's not just the quality of the food - it's as well a mixture of:
-Friendly Staff & Service
-Great Location, Safe Surroundings, & Pleasant Ambiance
-Expansive Seating
-Reasonable Price

Study Hall must not have gotten the memo, because not only does it fail to provide a pleasant dining experience with any of these facets - it goes out of its way to ensure you the most miserable dining experience possible.

1) Uncivil/Rude/Arrogant Staff: staff will sneer at your requests for condiments and ration them to you like its wartime (which should have included with your meal to begin with), after taking an unbelievable amount of time to bring you your food in the first place. If you spend too much time there after your meal chatting with your friends (as a pleasant dining experience usually entails, and is priced into your meal), you will be greeted by uncouth/unsettling advances to get you to leave. But for some reason, they expect you to tip when you pay for your meal upfront?

2) Terrible Location, Constant Noise of Traffic from busy Hoover St, Firetrucks constantly blaring down Hoover from Adjacent Fire Station, A/C set unreasonably high inside.

3) Seating inside is cramped and disjointed. You'll need to crane your neck in order to see a TV. If you sit outside, bring ear plugs to block out the noise from the street traffic, as well as the Top 40 blaring from the speakers. If you enjoy listening to One Direction on repeat, maybe this place is for you. But rarely will you ever hear the dialogue from sports games being played on the shoddy LCD TV's.

The chicken also was hard to bite off and chew, not very fresh either. Moreover, the house fries were actually the worst fries I've ever had. The fries were soggy, didn't have any flavor to them, and were low quality. It's really hard to make fries not taste good, but Study Hall did the impossible (see the picture I posted to see how disgusting the fries look).

Giving Study Hall 2 stars because the burger was at least edible and the service was great. The man who took my phone order and who rang me up were both friendly.

There is only 1 vegetarian option in each category so expect to pay more to have to customize (it's my biggest pet peeve to pay more just to not eat their meat (ｰ ｰ;)

Be careful what you tip, the service ends at the counter you order at. For $30 I think they can bring me a water in an adult glass. I asked for sauce and they literally told me to get it myself. They drop off your food and that's it. Didn't check on us once.

So if you keep all that in mind you can have an awesome time here! I got nachos, he got the why not burger and I made a veggie burger. All 100% delicious!",4 star rating
422,https://www.yelp.com/biz/study-hall-los-angeles-3,"In the aftermath of the war of chicken sandwiches between Popeyes and Chick Fil A; I found myself hungry for a fried chicken sandwich, and happened upon Study Hall during my recent visit to Los Angeles. This is how that went for me.

The Good: The atmosphere appears to be inspired (if not a little dark). I'm always a fan of lunch spots that offer a beer and wine list with some level of competence and in this, Study Hall didn't disappoint.

The Bad: The fried chicken sandwich was simply sad. Not only was the chicken reminiscent of chicken patties that you get served in...well public schools at least; the whole ensemble tasted of absolutely nothing. The sandwich was small and the plate was unbalanced, with the fries being the bulk of the meal by far.

The Business: A part of me really did expect the sort of food that a sit down restaurant could produce to be superior to that of Chick Fil A or Popeyes on a 'mechanics' level. I mean; they have more time to get it right and can make every sandwich to order, so why wouldn't they have the advantage? Sadly, the chicken sandwich from Study Hall didn't leave my craving for a chicken sandwich satisfied - the fries were the best part of the meal, so thankfully you get a lot of them.

423,https://www.yelp.com/biz/study-hall-los-angeles-3,"We were headed to a concert at the Shrine, across the street from USC, and needed somewhere for a pre-concert meal. Went to the Study Hall, and had a very nice if unusual meal. This place basically is a hang out for the USC students. Not necessarily a bad thing, as long as you know what you are getting into, but not quite what I am used to any more.

When you come in, you order at the front counter, pay, and then find yourself a spot. It is loud, crowded, and a bit dirty (reminds me of the places I used to hang out in college). But the food more than made up for it.

In particular, the brussels sprouts are like something from another planet! They are absolutely loaded with maple glazed pork belly ... chewed, salty, sweet, fatty, mmmmm! ... and have a fabulous sauce on top. They were served on a huge quarter hotel pan, and we could have made a meal out of them alone!

We also tried the chili cheese fries with the 28 spice chili, a decent version of chili cheese fries (and I'm sure sublime at 2 am when you're drunk!). The fries were nice and chunky, although maybe not quite as crispy as we would have liked, the chili was very tasty, and they had plenty of cheese on top.

The big miss was the buffalo wings. The sauce just wasn't anything special, and it totally ruined the dish.

All in all, if you are in the area, and aren't squeamish about filthy seats, the food was pretty good.",3 star rating

The burger has a homemade Angus beef patty with provolone cheese, pastrami, a fried egg, grilled onions and what I thought was a honey Dijon spread. It also comes with seasoned steak fries which were amazing too! The Study Hall is set up in away where it is not too cluttered and has just the right ambience for its location.

432,https://www.yelp.com/biz/study-hall-los-angeles-3,"Good food. Spendy. A burger will set you back $15. In spite of the clever name, this is not a daily dive. Dinner for two here will easily set you back seven hours of USC work-study pay. It's too bad too as the location makes it highly accessible. Maybe the kids driving their Teslas around (""I made my first million in bitcoin before enrolling in undergrad!"") can make this their regular. Wish it was ours.

Last I was there we had the M.O.S.C.H. burger and the L.A. Cobb salad. For $15 in a burger I have high expectations. This was a restaurant burger. It was tasty. But for $15 it didn't meet high expectations. The cobb ""features"" romaine and iceberge lettuce. In L.A.? At least give us the option to swap those out for spinach or arugula. FYI, Target down the street offers a pre-packed cobb for $3 that is about the same quality. TJ's gets fancy.

If they had a killer plate at a fair price we would make much more use of this place. But as it is, Study Hall is more bougie than necessary. Easy to walk passed and ignore in spite of the smells coming out of it.

I'm pretty sure that if their prices were 30% less we'd eat there 500% more. It would still be a $10 burger but at least they'd make it up in volume. For the money, try Nature's Brew up the street.",4 star rating

456,https://www.yelp.com/biz/study-hall-los-angeles-3,"Though a huge step up from the 2-9, this place is very much just ok. I've been here twice now, and both times were average experiences.

First off, the atmosphere is a lot better than it used to be. The cool blues, and decor give it a much more contemporary feel that suits a college area. It looks a lot cleaner than it was as the 2-9.

The first time I came here I split the Standard burger with my boyfriend. We both thought it was strange that the people who take your order didn't ask us how we wanted our burger cooked- that is pretty standard for any restaurant serving burgers. Though a little dry, the burger was pretty good. The egg really added a lot to the taste, and made it more exciting. I also really like their french fries.

The second time I came here, I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak. This was not nearly as good as the burger. The avocado wasn't fresh and the meat didn't look like a good cut at all. The chips it was served with were also not good, and flavorless. The meat here in general doesn't seem to be of very good quality.

Additionally, I think it's strange you can't sub anything for a side. I asked if I could trade out a side of French fries for something healthier and they told me the only side I could have were the fries. A lot of people like to have at least a side salad instead of fries and I think that is something they should at least offer in the future.

Overall, this place is affordable, and appropriate for a campus area.",3 star rating

Firstly, the chicken tenders were not great and definitely not worth $9. At least I got them relatively quickly, unlike my friend who didn't get her burger for 30 minutes. We asked at least twice when her food might come out, and the servers kept saying ""Oh your order will be out next. The veggie burger takes a little longer because it has to grill."" 1. SIX orders came out before my friend's did, including actual beef burgers which arguably take much longer to cook than a veggie patty. 2. It's a f***ing veggie patty. How long do you actually have to cook a veggie patty?! 3. If the order was forgotten, it would have been much better for the servers to just say that instead of continuously walking by our table and avoiding eye contact.

If that's your primary reason for visiting Study Hall you'll be alright. My gripes with this location is their service/operation as a sports bar/ restaurant which is a primary selling point for me. Given that they only have two satellite boxes there it's a constant battle with management over what games should be on the tv's and what broadcast gets put on the speakers. If LA teams are playing, PUT THEM ON THE TV and SPEAKERS. If the Lakers, Kings, Trojans, Dodgers are playing put them on the TV and put the sound on! (Obvious UCLA omission given our proximity to USC) Also, management is always running around and appears to not know how to run this place at times (like frantic pacing back and forth changing tv channels, changing audio, offering excuses, etc.) I feel like management gives in to whichever customer(s) complains the loudest and not to the customers that make sense.

A Victorian house typical of the area converted into a neighborhood cafe and bar. They did an awesome job...it retains the old architectural charm and has a modern vibe at the same time. It was very comfortable sitting there for an hour so with my husband watching one of the many large flat screen TVs.

I wasn't expecting much in the way of food options, but the chalkboard menu (again, really cute) was extensive and described REAL food, not just typical bar fare (even though that's what we ended up ordering). We got the happy hour burger sliders, house fries, pulled pork sliders, and cheesy tots. Everything was good and very flavorful, but the cheesy tots were the stand out. We gobbled those up with a quickness. All the portions were full size, too, not the normal teeny happy hour size.

As a non-red meat eater, especially appreciate that they allow for most of their beef patties in burgers to be replaced with chicken.

Only few recommendations... probably ditch the macaroons for another cheap and easy dessert. They freeze too much in that container, to the point where they taste bland and stale. Not a happy result for their size and price. Last time I went I was also given straight chips as my side for a panini which were rather unappetizing.

And who only have three options: study hall, the lab and 901 bar. Otherwise a business run like this wouldn't survive. It's heavily overpriced, the cheapest beer is $7. Right at the door, you're being asked to pay first- before you even receive the food, see it, get the drink or even see a table. I hate the concept of paying before receiving the service, that's why I avoid this place whenever I can. Still get carded by the little boys who work at the counter even though I'm 32. They also don't warn you when they're about to close: the other day we ordered some red wine, and as they brought it they told us they were closing in 5 minutes.
My friend was a regular who had a custom order (due to a diet), and they doubled the price on him from one day to the next, without even warning him. He used to be there three nights a week, now he doesn't go there anymore. We prefer buying a few beers at the store and drinking them on the porch or roof. Cheaper and more relaxed.

There's some seating available inside and plenty of tables found outside. I got the K-Town Ultra Ramen which was pretty good. The broth was the best part, flavorful and had a nice spicy kick to it. Instead of chashu this bowl had mini-sausages and spam, but I think I kinda prefer the chashu better. Overall, I really liked the bowl of ramen that I got and left feeling very full.

The interior is simple, long and narrow, but seating outside is also available should it be crowded. The food comes out very quickly, and they offer 3 hour validation to those who dine in and park at the structure underground. Which is a big plus and very convenient to those living in the area, because everyone knows that parking is always a struggle out in LA!

Ramen Kenjo offers both pork broth and chicken broth for those who cannot consume pork. A variety of appetizers and sides are also offered to supplement your meal, and they also sell rice bowls for those trying to avoid flour!

I ordered the MEAT-UP because I love my proteins. The meat was all delicious, I could do without the sausage, but the chashu pork and chicken was amazing. Well seasoned, perfectly tender and had excellent texture. The broth was good, but because I enjoy thicker, creamier broths, it was just okay. Had a good amount of flavor and I can't say that I didn't finish it.

But yesterday I did my own order and we ate inside and were served in proper big ramen bowls with big ladles, and it felt more like a real ramen restaurant experience.

I was pleased that the ramen was inexpensive for being technically located on a pricey college campus. We ordered from the more basic part of the menu and got shio and shoyu chicken-broth ramen bowls for only $9.50 each. They came with a good amount of toppings (corn, bean sprouts, scallions, nori sheet, and a gooey yolk half egg). If you want to add toppings a lot of them are only 50-80 cents. There are more premium toppings from $1-$2.50. Extra noodles are $2.

The portions were very large and filling. Great value! I like also that the chicken broth was very light and not fatty. They also have pork tonkotsu broth, which is heavier.

They have another menu section with more gourmet bowls priced around $12-$13. These ones have more meats and toppings added in.",4 star rating

Was super stoked to try this place out and was kind of satisfied~ This is located between Sunlife Organics and Baked Bear. It's a small shop, but there is actually some indoor seating (for about 15-20 people).

They just opened, so lots of students were lining up to dine in or to go. So, I waited 25-30 minutes. Hoping wait times go down in the future.

Karaage - Fried Chicken (3.5/5): Wow this was really expensive for $6.50. Chicken wasn't too bad, but it was a bit bland. It came with a sauce that was super spicy!! It was very heavy in siracha sauce, so that's probably why....

Shadow Maker - Tonkotsu Ramen with Char-Siu, black garlic oil, red ginger, and added topping of egg (3.5/5): Eh, not wowed but also not disappointed. The broth was pretty light compared to other ramen I've had in Little Tokyo and SGV. I heard from friends that the broth is super salty, but surprisingly mine was alright. Perhaps they watered it down? Anyhow, noodles were nice and chewy! They were stingy with the meat as I only got two slices. Char-Siu was bit hard to chew on and those slices had plenty of fat as well. Soft boiled egg was presented sloppily but it was pretty good. Oh, and, I didn't really feel the black garlic oil at all. So, I prefer Momota's on this aspect.

The ramen and toppings came in a separate container than the broth, to prevent everything from becoming soggy. When I poured in the broth, it was steaming hot and super fresh. There was a good portion of ramen and a plentiful amount of toppings which included kimchi, spam, kurobata sausages, cheese, bean sprouts, green onions, nori, and a half pickled egg. The broth was flavorful and addicting. I definitely recommend getting the K-Town, it is worth the price! Also, I got the chicken donburi which was nothing special.

1. Miso Hungry
Even though it's vegan friendly and miso broth base, but totally full of flavors. Came with baby bok Chou, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, shredded cabbage, half pickled egg, green onions and Nori seaweed sheet. I can't say more, you need to try by yourselves.

2. Meat up
Aha, this ramen is definitely a must for meat lovers! Including chasiu pork belly, kurobuta sausages, slow cooked chicken and corns. also their standard veggies toppings. A great balance of meat, carbs and veggies!

3. California rolls and seaweed salad for the sides.

4. Pork belly don, topped with teriyaki sauce, green onions and red ginger. It looks a little bit plain, but tastes really good!

5. Spicy tuna sushi burrito: this is my favorite item here! Huge and super bombs delicious!!! If you don't have time to sit down and eat ramen, just order this one to go, definitely worth every single penny!

When I rate ramen, I rate it by three things: The chasu (meat), the broth, and the noodles. The chasu was tasty but nothing spectacular, I've taster much softer. The broth was really good, and i really recommend the ""Shadow Maker"" because you can clearly taste the upgrade in tbe broth. The ramen noodles are egg based, but in my opinion not firm enough. I think if it was more firm, it would contrast the other toppings and the chasu more creating more texture.
Price wise, I feel like it is a little bit overpriced, but so is most things at USC. I liked eating my food outside on the tables, with a nice view and relaxing feel.

However, it is still in business right next to USC, that is filled with LA and SF natives. Los Angeles has some of the best ramen outside of Japan. Everyone I know can name at least 5 great, non-chain shops that they adore. So how, how is this place still open in what I assume is some of the most expensive real estate this side of LA?

I had the Meat Up as it was rather cheap, still $12.50, compared to the rest of the menu. The Chasiu Pork Belly was hard to chew through. Frankly, I expect pork that I could either bite off, split with my chopsticks, or at the very, very least is cut in a small enough piece so that I could put it in my mouth. The Chasiu was hard, large, and indestructible.

The egg is horrible. I make those kinds of eggs at home, they are called very well done, hard-boiled eggs. It is as if the chef decided: do you know what is better than a whole soft boiled egg that melts in your mouth? A half egg that would be better in an egg salad.

I get it, its next to the University of Spoiled Children and sometimes during a lunch rush there is nowhere better to eat. But holy hell people have taste buds.

I ordered their donburri rice with pork belly, I was there on my lunch for work and wanted to order something that would come out quickly. I had waited for about 20 minutes and finally asked the cashier how much longer my order would take. I hadn't seen the chef behind me and he shoved me with his shoulder on the way to the kitchen. He then proceeded to openly talk about how I was being ridiculous for asking how long my order would take to his co worker. I was very upset because I had been totally polite despite my food already running late while I'm on a time constraint. I have never been treated so wrongfully by people who are supposed to ""pride themselves in customer service."" Unless you want to get harassed for asking about your order then don't come here.

604,https://www.yelp.com/biz/ramen-kenjo-los-angeles-2,"What I ordered was Tonkotsu ramen.

Instead of a ramen bowl, the store uses flat paper bowl for ramen.

Within the Tonkotsu ramen, there are chashu, pink ginger, seaweed, boiled egg, and green onion.

The noodles are modicum thick, curled noodles. It's plain and does not match with the soup. The chashu is pretty good, but the smoky taste covers up the taste of the soup. The egg can be better if it is just like the one in traditional Japanese ramen store.

As for the bowl, it is kind of hard to eat with it in store since the base of the bowl is flat. So changing the bowl may provide convenience for people to enjoy their ramen.

Overall, I would give a 2.5 stars.",2 star rating

Then you choose a variety of dips (red pepper hummus, roasted eggplant) and proteins (lamb, honey chicken, grilled chicken, falafel, etc). Then toppings and sauces. And of course, get the pita on the side.

I appreciate how much chicken they scoop onto the bowl - it's double what Chipotle puts. They also have a huge selection of toppings and extras that make your bowl fun and flavorful. I've tried many combinations of bowls and the one thing I'd say is that the flavor profile is capped. Like, you know what to expect and it's as good as it gets no matter the combination. Maybe changing the meat will make it 10% better, but overall the flavor profile is pretty standard.

I'm so happy they are opening a Hollywood location soon!",5 star rating

683,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cava-los-angeles-4,"I love Cava but this location is NOT it. It's probably the worst location I've been to; perhaps, it is a victim of its own success b/c there is always a long line out that door that moves insanely slow.

I got in line around 2:15p and finally ordered around 2:50p. Food was fresh and filling though (consistent with other locations), so I guess it is up to you whether 30+ mins of wait time is worth it for fast casual food.

I stopped by b/c I was already at the Amazon lockers for errands, otherwise I would recommend ordering ahead online (and maybe giving it an extra 10 mins just in case).",3 star rating

685,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cava-los-angeles-4,"I had an unfortunate incident with their front entrance door, which I would say had a design flaw with it being way too light.

I opened the large doors with normal force, but again the doors were unusually too light.

This happened back in June 19, 2019 around 3:19 PM. I told and showed the manager of what had happened. He seemed protective of himself and the business, and made me sign a document, and assured me that someone will reach out to me. He didn't say a word of apology or anything else. I'm here to inform CAVA and fellow customers that absolutely no one had reached out.

I am making this review today, as I can say that this incident had prevented me from participating from a tournament that I had been training diligently for only having to pull out. Being an athlete, I can say that seemingly small incident deeply impacted the trajectory of my athletic endeavors. I am upset that no one had reached out to me till this day.",1 star rating

I decided to go with pickled onions, hummus, feta cheese, tzatziki, and cucumber+tomato salad.

Truly the best falafel I've ever had. Their pickled onion add-on is my absolute favorite and their red pepper hummus is literally heaven.

It's almost like a Mediterranean Chipotle but way healthier. With more options on the sauces and sides I think this place has Chipotle beat on healthy and options.

I really liked the bowl I get here even though it's a little pricey because of the meat choice. I start off with the greens and grains bowl and I get the brown rice and baby spinach, then I chose Hummus, garlic, and red tahini, for the meat I got braised lamb but they charge an extra $3, for the last part of the bowl I get crumbled feta, tomato cucumber, and the cauliflower quinoa, and lemon herb tahini.

On Saturday evening (4/29/23) between the hour of 8pm-9pm (I'm putting the time because I want them to check the footage) they were really just with online orders. He kept yelling obnoxiously that it would be a 10-15 minute wait for the people in line. They are always busy so I waited patiently. Instead of helping, he was walking behind the staff and at some point a gossiping. A few of us in line started to notice that he was a bit off balance and looked to be unwell. He was struggling to put one glove on.

He then approaches the line and looks me up and down and roles his eyes and myself with other patterns are like what the hell is wrong with him. Fast forward (I'm in line for at least 20 minutes by now) he starts to help with starting the bowls. We immediately noticed that his affect and response time was delayed, he was tripping over himself and sweating profusely as if whatever drug he had taken had just kicked in. His speech was slurred and he was making a mess on the line. I proceeded to ask if some one else could make my bowl and he got an attitude and threw a fit. When I went to pay for my food, someone in front of me was already complaining about him to the assistant manager. When it's my turn to pay, he comes up to the register and sarcastically says ""you go have a nice day"" looks me up and down and rolls his eyes. The assistant manager sees his behavior and tells him to go to the back. She apologized on his behalf and provided me my bowl for free. I'm telling her they need to drug test him because he looks like he is high on something.

He then comes back out and starts cursing belligerently in front of patrons and was asked to go in the back again. He carried on this behavior and was extremely unprofessional.

NO ONE WANTED TO HELP ME and I use too work here it not that hard to be nice to someone but to get pass down to person to person for a pita that you paid online for really suck and to get ignored just makes a person wanna stop coming. Once i got my pita I told the person how I feel getting ignored she told me that's she just started her shift and has nothing to do with it.

The employees are super rude. I pre-ordered and arrived at their promised time to pick up my order. My order was not ready, and I politely asked them to check my order. It is fine to wait but they kept serving people who the order time was after mine, so I reminded them again. The girl was very unhappy. After 30-40 minutes, she gave me my order and there were no forks, (She gave forks from a plastic container for other customers). I asked her for a fork. She could have just taken one fork from the container right in front of her for me, but she raised her brows and told me to grab one myself. So, I opened the container and about to grabbed one, but to my shock, she punched the container lid to stop me and told me to get the fork from the supplier after me. Maybe she had a bad day, but this is really bad experience for me as a customer.

I love getting the greens and grain bowl, which lets me lighten up on the starch carbs and pack it with raw kale, cabbage, and field greens lettuce. From there I can load up on hummus, baba ghanoosh, roasted carrots and cauliflower, pickled stuff, and lots more plants.

This CAVA location is inside the USC Village. Enter off Hoover and go into the underground structure for parking, and then you can get like an hour's free parking with validation.

It is around $10 after tax for a bowl which is a great deal for healthy eating on a college campus. Often the line is out the door, but it moves pretty quickly. If you're low on funds, go for the half pita sandwich with side soup which I think is around $7.",5 star rating

Aside from that, their flavors are actually really good. Think of it as a Mediterranean Chipotle bowl.

anyways, cava was cool. the food tasted really yum! and the drinks/ juices were SOOOO FUN AND GOOD!!! they had such fun flavors! the only thing was that they only provided paper straws. i understand saving the turtles and attempting to be sustainable, however, they gave me A FULLY PLASTIC CUP AHDJOAIDIAJKSJSK WHAT IN THE FUCKING HYPOCRITE SHIT IS THIS?!!?! if they gave me a paper cup and paper straw, i would be completely fine and happy!!!! but NOoOoOoOoOooo!!! i had to deal with the weak ass paper straw :( they only do performative sustainability for aesthetics

after we got our food, we sat outside! it was really nice! we had a fun time catching up with mason, and getting to know olivia.

afterwards, we left. the rest of the day was filled with driving back, running errands, and attending the going away party. if you were wondering, the party was a lot of fun! it was a great last hurrah for all of us, before we left and moved for college across the country. the end of the night was really sad because we said our final goodbyes to some people. but overall, it was a great day. thanks cava!",5 star rating

You pick your protein, sauce, vegetables, and toppings just like at Chipotle. The portions are huge and will definitely fill you up. They have various side toppings and I wish they would label these so it would be easier to identify what each was, but if you're not a picky eater, I would just recommend getting everything. All the flavors mix well together.

We got lucky and beat the rush, because about 20 minutes after we sat down, there was a line going out the door.

This is probably the only place that would have been my ""go-to"" takeout place. Thankfully, they also have a branch in Pasadena but this one is closer to me. Back when they were open, they validate for free two-hour parking.

Their portions are huge for me and one bowl feeds me for two meals at least. I always get the Greens + Grains Bowl. I either get their SuperGreens or SplendidGreens, Saffron White Rice with their Tzatziki, Roasted Red Pepper Hummus, and the regular Hummus spreads. For the protein, they let me get half Grilled Meatballs (two pieces) and half Roasted Vegetables. If you order online (in the Pasadena location), the site also lets you split your choice of Protein that way.

Their Toppings is where they really shine for me. I love pickled things so their variety really makes it for me. I always get the Cabbage Slaw, Tomato & Onion, Diced Cucumber, Tomato & Cucumber, Cauliflower Quinoa Tabbouleh, Pickled Onions, and Peral Couscous. Their Dressings also make me drool. I get their Yogurt Dill and Lemon Herb Tahini. They also give you a free pita bread with any bowl order.

It's always consistent, refreshing, healthy, and filling. I've loved this place ever since I tried it when I visited Washington DC. I'm SO glad they finally came to LA! They are SO much better than Chipotle, in my opinion.",5 star rating
824,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cava-los-angeles-4,"CAVA = A Middle Eastern Chipotle.

Literally.

Instead of your typical American-Mexican ingredients, you got Middle Eastern. You order down a line, selecting your grains, veggies, protein, sauces, toppings etc. It felt like a healthier version of fast food.

I wish Cava offered more grain selections instead of just rice or black lentils. It would have been really cool to see wheatberries, farro, barley, or quinoa as options, but I guess that isn't very Middle Eastern?

Anyways, I LOVE Tahini but I also wish they gave more of it instead of just zig zagging across the top. $12 for a bowl isn't bad but it wasn't very filling either.

I'd probably come back if there weren't any other good options around. Not super stoked about this place, but it wasn't bad either!",4 star rating

Next choose a protein option followed by various side toppings such as olives, tomatoes, etc. lastly you can choose a sauce such as lemon herb or green harissa.

Ordering simple b/c it's basically styled like Chipotle or Panda Express where you just choose what you want and start eating right away! A little more pricy than Chipotle and a little less filling, but I don't come by Mediterranean food often. I took ONE bite and I LOVED it. The combination of flavors was on point (I got a grain bowl w/ half brown rice, half lentil rice, half falafel, half beef meatball, and all of the add-ons [except beets....can't do beets] with the Green Harissa to top it off). I went on a Sunday for lunch.

~Pros: Their spicy sauces are a perfect kick to the food! They let you go half and half on a lot of things like the rice and lentils and the protein selections. It's nice how they have options to sit inside the restaurant as well as outside.

~Cons: My meat ball was a a hint to salty, but it could be b/c I'm a weakling when it comes to salty meat.

~RETURN: I would definitely come back, but sparingly because they're a $$ place with their bowls starting off at $10.30 min. They have an app that has a rewards system embedded into it to earn points and order w/o having to wait in line.",4 star rating

836,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cava-los-angeles-4,"This is one of the first storefronts that are open in the USC Village. Expect long lines (~15 mins) due to the grand opening and limited food options elsewhere. I've never been to this chain before, but you'll quickly become attuned to their ordering style because it's exactly the same as Chipotle's.

First, you choose from a selection of base options: salad, greens + grains, soup, all grain, pita, or mini pitas. I chose basmati brown rice.

Second, you choose three drips from these choices eggplant red pepper, tzatziki, crazy geta, hummus, harissa and red pepper hummus. I chose Tzatziki, crazy feta, and harissa. I'll admit that after I mixed by bowl around, I couldn't tell the difference between flavors. The one that stood out the most ot me was crazy feta which is jalapeno feta.

Third, you choose one protein from falafel, lamb meatball, beef, veggies, chicken, sirloin meatball, braised lamb. I just said meatball which i believe they gave me lamb meatball by default.

Fourth, as for the toppings, you can ask for all of them or just some of them. It's a long list, but my favorites were olives, cauliflower quinoa, crumbled feta, and white bean. I advise against adding pickled banana peppers unless you absolutely like sour. I mistook them to be normal banana peppers like Subway's, but was sourly mistaken. This made my bowl extra sour mixed with the pickled onions.

Lastly, you can choose your dressing, which comes as sriracha yogurt, spicry apricot, yogurt dill, greek vinaigrette, lemon herb tahini and green harissa. I should've heeded the warnings of my friend to ask the dressing to be put in sauce cups. That way, you can control the amount of sauce to pour in and not have the flavors mix in an odd fashion. My bowl came out to be drenched in sauce from the dressings and dip/spread. My fault.

The resulting product is a bowl that is a healthy treat, which can be portioned as lunch and dinner. As with all healthy places, there is a price to pay. For this, the total was around $10.50. It's a great option if you're just coming back from a workout or run.",4 star rating

First you start with your base. Whether it be all grains, all salad, or half and half, they got you covered. They have a variety of grains you can choose from and a lot of different types of healthy greens. You then move to the dips and spreads where you can choose between variations of hummus and other dipping sauces. You then top it off with a protein of your choice! They offer all sorts of land animals and for those who only eat veggies, offer a delicious selection of savory vegetables. Move on to toppings where you can pile on more vegetables and garnishes!

The ingredients are always fresh, and it's so yummy and I think it's on the healthier side. I don't always stay full for long after Cava, but for around $10, it's a great deal for really good food.",4 star rating

869,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cava-los-angeles-4,"I'm such a big fan of Mediterranean food and didn't even know that CAVA was a mediterranean version of chipotle. I live in a rock.

FOOD:
Choose your base (I got the greens/grains).
Choose 3 spreads (I recommend the hummus, red pepper & eggplant)
Choose your protein (I got 1/2 falafel and chicken)
Choose your toppings (I got tomato/cucumber, onions, pearls, and olives)
Choose your sauce (I got the lemon one)
The bowl was excellent. Kind of saucy so I'd recommend getting the spreads and sauces on the side so you can determine how much you want to ass on your own.

SERVICE: Whatever...I'm not surprised but it was only bad bc the workers seemed like they were rushing us. It was my first time at CAVA and I had to choose really fast and felt like I couldn't look at my options. When I asked what the topping at the top was they didn't bother to tell me but they just said that the options are on the glass screen. Shit my bad for not looking but they could have been nice about it. Don't expect much because this is a fast food.

LOCATION & PARKING: sucks because its in the USC village so you're going to have to pay for parking unless you get it validated at Trader Joes or their machine breaks lol. Either way parking/location sucks for non USC students but SOOOO confident for USC students lol.",3 star rating

PARKING: There is USC Village parking. I didn't park at the USC Village parking structure, so I'm not sure if CAVA validates. Heard validation is only for an hour though. Street parking may be your best bet.

Swung by here for dinner one night and there was, of course, a line! There is literally always a line at CAVA, just like how there's always a line at Chipotle.

Either way, CAVA never fails to disappoint! Glad it's now on the West Coast. This is the 2nd West Coast location I've been to, the other being in Irvine. I always get the half & half base (half yellow rice and half arugula). You really can't go wrong with anything here since you're picking exactly how you like it!

There is plenty of flavor in the humus and I highly recommend the crazy feta and the red pepper hummus. I got half chicken and half meatball. Both were a delicious addition to the bowl. Chicken was plentiful but the meatball was only two pieces for half a serving. It was seriously delicious and flavorful and I would recommend to try it at least once. Portion is a tad small which is the downside. For toppings, you can pick whatever you fancy but I got the crumbled feta which was a must! For dressing (it's honestly more sauce to go along with your dips), I got the yogurt dill. When they mixed all of that together, I honestly could not tell the difference. The sauce was a tad heavy and it drenched the entire dish. Overall, this place is a go-to place for many USC students. It is decently priced and at a prime location.

I really like 4 of the 6 available dips, the hummus, red pepper hummus, eggplant + red pepper, and tzatziki. For the protein options, I always get half roasted vegetable with something else although the falafel isn't the best thing I've had. The meatballs and chicken are both flavorful! Next, I usually get almost all the toppings, I think they provide great texture and fresh flavors to the bowl so you never really get sick of eating your bowl.

Each time I go, I know I will always be helped by people that are genuinely kind and welcoming. I go on the not-too-great days because each employee always turns that around. I can't say the same for any other restaurant/company in the area.

This goes for everyone that works there; however, I also want to specifically call out (in the best way possible) Edgar and Justin because they deserve trophies for the last time I came in. I wasn't having the best day and, simply by how friendly they were, they changed that for me.

I have never liked lamb... so I ordered up a bowl with a double shot of lamb (in braised and spicy meatball form). I was very pleasantly surprised with my meal... it was vibrant, colorful, lots of textures and flavors going. The harissa sauce was delish, and I licked the plate clean.

Cava is like the Mediterranean version of Chipotle. There are various bowls you can get with greens and/or rice. I opted for the greens and grains bowl with brown rice and romaine lettuce. Their grilled chicken was pretty good. I enjoyed putting the various toppings including olives and feta cheese and their several sauce/dip options. I personally like the tahini lemon sauce.

They were out of tzatziki which I found weird given the type of food, but whatever.

Once you get to the toppings selection, that's where you can bulk up your bowl with a bunch of vegetables. The banana peppers was my favorite one. I wish I asked for extra.

Although visiting on a Sunday at 5pm, we found it pretty crowded inside.

The food was decent and I'm sure I would've had a better experience at another location but WOW what a disaster this place was. On a college campus so not sure if they made a difference. They were out of like half of the items on the menu. No brown rice, no romaine (ok fine it's recalled), no lamb, no roasted veggies, no cauliflower, the list goes on. No ice at the soda machine. No forks or napkins. This was seriously a horrible dining experience. Onto the food: tasted good but there is one size: huge. Didn't even eat half of it. Took it home but it's not as good the next day because you can't reheat it. You want the rice and meat hot but the greens and sauces cold.

Mediterranean style fast food, similar to Chipotle. It's not authentic Mediterranean food, but it is still pretty good! Quality ingredients and generous portions.

It's cheap (around 10 dollars including tax for a rice bowl) Their rice is pretty good too (white basmati and brown)

Tip: I would get the sauces and dressing on the side if you don't want anything too filling or heavy. The sauces can be a bit creamy.

Ordered romaine and they were out. Needed to get some from the back so the server skipped us...?
Why not go get the romaine which he eventually had to do. You go down the line and add into your pita or bowl or salad but since you can't see what they say they have you have to ask constantly...What is that? I finally said Sorry I've never been here.
Then we get to check out and we order two fountain sodas. They give us the cups and the soda machine says out of service!!!! Why sell us fountain sodas. Why not say it's out of order?
So we tried one of there iced teas which was just ok.

Food - chicken dried out, lamb - dark and rusty cant even figure out whether its lamb coz it doesn't taste like lamb. You have to eat coz they said its lamb.

Customer service - Me and my friends went to Cava recently. Few of them were first timers to cava. CAVA expects everyone to know their menu byheart. No item names were written near to the dish. All dish names are written on the lower corner of the glass that is far away from the dish. And ur service agents dont have enough patience and manners to let us read the menu.

A - "" hi""
CAVA - no smile or greetings , "" wat protein you want""
A- "" wat do u have?""
CAVA- "" it's on the list""
A - Where's is the list?
CAVA - eyes rolled, lost all his patience with one exhale."" Its over there""
A - "" where is this dish (lamb)"" coz its fucking drowned in oil you cant figure out among 9 dishes where is lamb dish.
CAVa - "" this is lamb and he added"" without asking me.
A - okay, maybe he is new here
CAVA - another guy "" Wat salad u want?"" Again with bad expressions on face
A - where is this xxx sauce ? What is in it?

It comes with 3 dips/spreads and with the chips is like an appetizer itself.,4 star rating
956,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cava-los-angeles-4,"This was my first time trying this and I had actually been looking forward to it! This place has been in my yelp bookmarks for a while now but never got around to going because it is a little out of the way for me but since I knew I was going to go to the natural history museum today, I planned on checking this place out for lunch.

This is pretty much a chipotle-style Mediterranean cafe. After looking through the yelp reviews, I settled on a greens and grains bowl. I picked the superfood blend of greens which included kale, brussle sprouts and a bunch of other good-for-you greens. I also added the white basmati rice and the black lentils. Okay guys the lentils are DANK!!!

Then you choose your dips, I got eggplant and red pepper, crazy feta and tazziki. The eggplant and red pepper wasn't as good as I thought but the tazziki was great, creamy and tangy and the crazy feta was good too, a little over powering though.

Next came the protein, I chose the beef meatballs.
The meatballs had a lot of really good flavor but they were cooked too long so they came out dry
:(((((

Then you can choose your toppings, there are sooo many different toppings to choose! I got the cucumber and tomato salad (really good), feta cheese, quinoa and cauliflower tabouleh (ehhh it was just alright), cabbage salad (good), lemon wedge, fresh mint(must get, gives a fresh bite( and pita crisps(ask for extra, yum LOL)

Finally comes the sauce/dressings. I only got the lemon herb tahini as it is the house favorite but tbh it made everything taste the same. The problem that I had with my bowl is that I got tired of the flavor after the first 4-5 bites. It def needed something more acidic to balance it out bc all I tasted was the heavy and creamy tahini sauce. I think if I had gotten the Greek vinaigrette alongside it, it would have given my bowl the prefect acidic bite.

If I'm ever in the area and I wanted fast and healthy Mediterranean inspired food, I would stop by but it's def not something I will go out of my way to get.",3 star rating

When I was there for the first time, they just opened and my food and overall experience were amazing! I must say the portion size was decent (my first time), and falafel was very delicious and enough for me (they put 5 pieces). I also chose half-and-half with brown rice and some greens. Mixed it with veggies and tzatziki dip, dressing - sesame oil or something like that.
OVERALL - first time: decent portion, delicious, kind and efficient service.

SECOND TIME - omg what happened? Very sad experience.
SAD - I wanted to get the same combo of rice, greens, falafel, veggies, and some dressing.
BUT falafel - the put two tiny balls (???). when I asked if the could put more, the woman (irritated obviously) asked ""okay how many you want?"" - how about just normal amount???
Rice and greens - they made sure they put just enough to cover the bottom of the plate and that's it. ???
AS for the service - people seemed to be really annoyed and NOT friendly at all. I mean I understand everyone could have a bad day, but really I was pretty happy before I came in there...I got really bummed with all this..

1. When I got up to the salad portion of the bar he asked me what I wanted, and when I replied arugula he interrupted me with ""Ay, homie..""

I looked at him and realized that he wasn't even paying attention to me, he was talking to some guy behind me. I wait for him to finish so that he can say ""uh, what'd you want?"" again and I have to repeat what I said.

2. He asked me what sauces I want, I said ""feta, hummus, and harissa"" and he says ""regular hummus?"" I say ""yeah"" and before I know it he is scooping the regular hummus AND the roasted red pepper hummus (which isn't what I asked for) into my bowl and tends to the girls in front of me before I can say anything. I know this all sounds superficial and stupid but when you have had a long day at work and just want to grab dinner and go home, this type of thing is frustrating.

3. He comes back to me and i ask him ""hey can I get the harissa?"" He says ""it costs extra"" and I say ""yeah.. but I had asked for the harissa.""

He SHAKES his head at me like I'm dumb and taps his ear, telling me ""you gotta listen..."". Wait, I asked for harissa and you gave me the wrong sauce so how are you going to stand there and tell ME to listen?

4. At this point we are both clearly miffed at each other and he dryly asks me what protein I want, I say chicken. And he actually says to me, ""are you SURE?""

Ok, WHAT?? Did I say something offensive to you??

I had to explicitly tell him that I actually asked for the harissa and he can't just act like I didn't say what I said when he clearly just wasn't listening. He chuckled and just passed my bowl along like he didn't hear me. The girls in front of me looked at me like I was THAT chick who makes a scene and asks for the manager at McDonald's.

We arrived around 1pm and the line had reached the door. I had read previous reviews comparing it to chipotle so I figured the line would move fairly quickly, and it did. After picking my base the guy asked if I wanted a pita and I said yes. However, when I got to the cashier, I noticed that my friend had a pita and I didn't. I told the cashier that I didn't get my pita and she looked at me with a look of total disgust and said (like it was my fault I didn't get it) ""oh you wanted a pita??"" And I answered ""yea I asked for one"". She stomped her feet towards the front where the pitas were and my friend started to say it's ok she can have mine but I stopped him bc I didn't want to take his and I did let them know at the front of the line FOR A FACT that I wanted a pita. When she got back she practically tossed it at us. I eat out a lot and I can't remember or don't ever think I have ever been talked to that way. I can't understand why someone with that attitude would choose to work in the service industry. Everyone else was nice. Whoever is the manager should review the footage and see for yourself.

Although that off-putting incident did ruin my experience, the food tasted really good. I got a rice and salad bowl with beef meatballs.

The second time I got all falafel. On the positive side, you do get a lot of other goodies in your bowl to make up for the lack of protein, which is why I still give this place 4 stars. You get to pick three dips and can add as many of the toppings as you like. I recommend getting the salad dressing on the side, and you can pick as many as you want. The bowls come with a piece of pita on the side if you'd like, and I like dipping the pita in the dips and dressings. The bowls are very filling, especially if you get a pita. All the dips, toppings, and dressings create an explosion of flavor that makes you want to keep coming back for more.

You might be better off going to get something small at Trader Joe's instead and validate parking there if you're going to be in the village over an hour!",4 star rating

This was the foundation of my plate so that wasn't good, the meatballs were burnt and crunchy, the falafel were dry (didn't taste fresh), the greens weren't anything crunchy and exciting (the rice was crunchier), the basil lemonade was just basil. They ran out of bags, the container lids didn't fit the plates, there wasn't anything we could do at this point after
standing in line for over 30 minutes. My food was 20.00, which I'm still confused by. So a quick synopsis: uncooked crunchy brown rice, burnt meatballs that had a sour smell & taste, warm salad, no bags to carry our purchases (we walked from our office), I'll fitting containers and lids, no discount for the inconvenience, basil and no lemonade, long lines.... I am disappointed because we both had upset stomachs after eating our food at our desks. I wanted to love it, but the price, lack of product, and poor overall experience was a waste of 20.00 for one person.

- you can split proteins
- harrisa and crazy feta are amazing but spicy.

1025,https://www.yelp.com/biz/cava-los-angeles-4,"Wow, I totally get why there is a long line here!

I came here after a meeting at school, and just needed something to fill me up for the day. I was really hungry, and I have always heard good things about this place.

The line was really long when I went, but I got in front of the line relatively fast. It's a Chipotle-style restaurant, where you choose your base as either with rice, greens, or both. The are various options for the greens, from arugula to your super greens consists of raw brussel sprouts and kale. You can also choose various kinds of meats, from chicken and beef to spicy lamb balls and falafel, and they offer various kinds of hummus that fulfills every hummus lover's dream. They also have various toppings, from your cucumber tomato salad to a quinoa salad. You are lastly guided to different dressings, from your greek-based dressing to a sriracha-based dressing. It's honestly pretty easy to follow through, and it's really overwhelming to look at because of the different options. The prices for these bowls are higher than Chipotle, so expect to pay a little over $10 for your bowl.

The interior of the place is very clean, but very small. But I really wish there was another door that was on the opposite side of the restaurant, so that people can come in an out of the restaurant fast.

In terms of food, I got their grain and greens bowl with chicken, tzatziki sauce, super greens (raw brussel sprouts and kale), eggplant and red pepper hummus, and roasted red pepper hummus. My toppings were cabbage slaw, pickled onions, cucumber and tomato salad, cherry tomatoes, cauliflower quinoa salad, and the sriracha greek yogurt dressing. Here are some highlights from my bowl:
- Meat wise, the chicken was pretty good. I believe any meat option you get here would be solid, but I would totally love to try the spicy lamb balls next time.
- Out of all of the crazy sauces I got, I would totally cut down the amounts of hummus and sauces I got. I definitely favored the roasted red pepper hummus, the tazatziki sauce, and the sriracha greek yogurt. To make this a healthier bowl, I would ask the sriracha greek yogurt dressing on the side and choose only one of the hummus options.
- The toppings were all exceptional. They were super refreshing from all of the crazy sauces I ate. I would probably get the same things next time.

Parking is downstairs in the USC Village or street parking. I heard the USC Village parking is pretty decent, so I would say save some time and park there.

Service was really great! Despite the crowd, they were willing to help me with my bowl and were patient with me as I struggled to take out my wallet to pay. So good.

This place is a nice addition to the plethora of restaurants that are around USC. You can make this bowl very healthy, or be drenched in sauces and hummuses. Nonetheless, I would totally come back here in the future when I need a good healthy lunch fix.",5 star rating

I decided to give this location a try and the overall experience was nowhere close to the others. For starters, they were out of half of the dressings, feta, olives and romaine lettuce. Now I can understand if it's right before closing, but this was at 7:00. The quality of the food was also inferior; the crazy feta dip was watery and had this yellow tinge to it, and the pita was only half cooked with a lot of raw dough. Lastly, the service was HORRIBLE compared to the other locations. Instead of using the spoons to scoop up toppings, the employees just used their hands; it reminded me of Subway. When it came time to pay, they ran out of bags, giving me the response of ""no, we don't have any."" No sorry, no nothing. Unacceptable.

You can make it healthy, or if you want something heartier you can construct your bowl like that as well by choosing a grain base rather than the salad base. I am a fan of all the spreads I've tried, including the red pepper hummus, eggplant and red pepper, but especially the crazy feta, which I highly suggest getting. From the dressings I've only tried the apricot dressing but I really liked it, I didn't think it was overly spicy at all. I thought the chicken was pretty good too. I'm definitely coming back to try the other protein selection as well, they all looked really good. There will likely be a line when you go, but it's chipotle-style so it goes by pretty quickly.

My husband got 2 scoops of ice cream on a deluxe cookie (Triple chocolate). He got cookie dough and vanilla scoops. The vanilla was so good. Didn't taste artificial at all. Cookie dough was good too. Not too sweet. But the scoops were ginormous! Even for 2 people it was slightly too much. We couldn't finish it. Probably one scoop would have been enough.

You can under cook a cookie, you can serve a cold cookie, you can mess things up in a much less brutal way than serving week old stuff at a place like this. Find a different thing to do, stop making cookies, go find your passion, but don't do this to people. You don't want to make cookies, and we don't want to suffer your wrath, please just find something else to do. It would be much better for everyone involved. .

The worst part is how they package it all nice and tell you warm cookies are on their way, you open it and realize they just sent you a box of gravel with cheesecake frosting to dip it in.

I'd never had it before, but many of my friends had and would talk highly of it so my expectations were set pretty high. I was not disappointed -- this is the first time I'd had a cookie both warm, crispy, and chewy all at the same time. I can't even describe how the cookie was able to be all that in one bite, but summary is Insomnia Cookies was able to accomplish it. The line can get pretty long at night (the first week I waited 45 minutes in line) but there are periods of time where the line is pretty short. The other thing is that the cookies are pretty sweet, so I can usually only eat one before feeling too sugar-heavy. Definitely check out Insomnia Cookies if you're craving a sweet treat!",4 star rating

1138,https://www.yelp.com/biz/insomnia-cookies-los-angeles-3?osq=cookie,"This review is mainly towards the location of the shop. I've been wanting to try insomnia cookies for so long. We got here after 10PM because it is open until 1AM or so. We parked under the USC village parking and went looking for the place. Turns out, only USC students are allowed to go into the area where the cookies are located after 10PM. Per the worker that was managing the entrance (which of course was not their fault as they were just following rules given to them) If we wanted to get the cookies, we would have to order online, then call them so that they can bring it out to us. If you wanted to go in and order from them, you would have to come before 10PM to enter. It was a bummer as we just had a late dinner coming from an event only to find out the dessert place we wanted to try was blocked off to the public after a certain time. I probably would not come back just for that reason, but I'm just being petty at that point. Will go try the other locations another time though haha.",1 star rating
1139,https://www.yelp.com/biz/insomnia-cookies-los-angeles-3?osq=cookie,"These cookies are so warm and delicious! Thanks to the Cookie Magic membership (which I had for 2 months), I was able to try all their flavors over time. It's free for your first month and costs $10 for subsequent months. With the Cookie Magic membership, you get 1 free classic cookie per day, $1 deluxe cookies every day, and various other deals that cycle out on a weekly basis. Usually, the other deals entail BOGO for their 6- or 12-pack cookies or their big/lil dippers (sets of cookies that come with a side of icing dipping). For Insomnia Week, the deal was a free 6-pack of cookies (no purchase necessary), and it was amazing!

My one qualm with the app is that it does not let you redeem a free daily cookie until 24 hours have passed since your previous day's cookie. So if I come in at 11pm on one day but at 1pm the next day, I can't use the app again. Usually, the employees are nice and will let you show your proof of membership instead.

Out of the classics, my favorites were chocolate chunk, M&M's, and vegan birthday cake. All three of these had a great balance of flavor every time I tried them. Just after those three in terms of ranking, I'd place the snickerdoodle cookie. I was pleasantly surprised by this flavor since I don't usually find myself drawn to snickerdoodle, but it was executed really well and tasted amazing. After the snickerdoodle, I liked the double chocolate mint and double chocolate chunk. Both of these did a good job balancing the chocolate chunks with the chocolate batter to make sure the flavor wasn't too overwhelmingly chocolatey. Next up is the sugar cookie: it was good, but not stellar in any regard. I'd prefer a snickerdoodle over another sugar cookie because it added a more interesting flavor. But these were still solid cookies. Then comes the peanut butter chip, white chocolate macadamia, and oatmeal raisin. Peanut butter chip was only okay to me. It didn't feel like it offered anything particularly unique, and I've had better peanut butter cookies elsewhere. White chocolate macadamia honestly felt underwhelming. I felt like the Costco white chocolate macadamia nut cookies taste better than the ones from Insomnia Cookies. Oatmeal Raisin is at the bottom of this list because I just don't really love raisins in cookies. This one was completely just based on subjective personal taste. If you love oatmeal raisin, give it a try and you'll love it!

Out of the vegan options only, birthday cake was by far my favorite, but vegan chocolate chunk was also solid. My least favorite flavor was vegan double chocolate chunk; they somehow managed to make it taste like dust even though their other vegan flavors are delicious. None of the other cookies tasted as bad as the vegan double chocolate chunk (even the non-vegan double chocolate chunk tasted like a delicious normal cookie).

Out of the deluxe cookies, my personal favorite was the triple chocolate chunk because I loved how gooey and chocolatey it was. I also really liked the s'mores cookie because it had a good balance of flavors. If I didn't love chocolate so much, s'mores would definitely be my favorite flavor. The oatmeal chocolate walnut was a good middle-ground balance as well, but it did not stand out as much as the s'mores. Same goes for the confetti cookie (I actually liked the vegan birthday cake better than this one).

Onto the last two deluxe cookies: chocolate peanut butter cup and salted caramel. I was very excited to try these two because I love Reese's peanut butter cups, and I love salted caramel ice cream, but I was honestly disappointed by both of them. The chocolate peanut butter cup cookie had an overwhelming peanut butter flavor with not much chocolate to balance it out. It felt less like eating a gooey cookie and more like eating peanut butter straight from a jar. Even the cookie texture contributed to this feeling. The salted caramel cookie had a similar problem of being too caramel-y without much to balance it. I couldn't really taste any salt. In fact, I couldn't taste anything other than an overwhelming amount of caramel. I was very disappointed because I would usually love these two flavors, but both of these cookies were not that good.

My overall ranking of all the cookies is as follows:
1. vegan birthday cake
2. chocolate chunk
3. M&M's
4. deluxe triple chocolate chunk
5. deluxe s'mores
6. snickerdoodle
7. vegan chocolate chunk
8. deluxe oatmeal chocolate walnut
9. double chocolate chunk
10. double chocolate mint
11. deluxe confetti
12. sugar
13. gluten-free chocolate chip
14. peanut butter chip
15. white chocolate macadamia
16. deluxe chocolate peanut butter cup
17. deluxe salted caramel
18. oatmeal raisin (again, this is just because I don't like oatmeal raisin. I'm sure if you like this flavor, you'll love this version of it.)
19. vegan double chocolate chunk (if this was the first cookie I ever tried from Insomnia Cookies, I genuinely would have decided to never return to the store. It was that bad.)",4 star rating

The mango jicama chicken salad is to DIE FOR. I actually got recommended this from a friend and I really didn't expect myself to enjoy a salad this much. If this place sold the dressing I would buy a gallon of it. It is perfectly balanced - crunchy, salty, sour, sweet. The sweetness of the mango pairs so well with the sourness of the jicama. I thought I wasn't a fan of jicama until I tried this salad! The chicken is wonderfully seasoned and I loved the addition of pasta noodles in it so you get different textures. The portion is huge too and it tasted great the next day! I woke up excited to eat the rest lol. The breakfast burrito is also delicious, my bf said he didn't feel heavy after eating it which is rare for a breakfast burrito. He loved the creaminess of the eggs. The matcha is so delicious, but it's very sweet. It seemed like a popular drink as we saw many people like up just for it.

The servers are all very nice. Helpful.

The ambiance is chill, here's not much indoor seating nor room inside and a small area in the front so the line ends up extending outside. There always seems to be a line here.

when i recently went there was a huge line during midday with maybe 20 people in line. luckily it went by pretty quick. during certain hours they serve lunch and dinner, as well as prepped salads. their oreo donut and toasted coconuts flake donuts are amazing. but like i said, the star of the show for me is definitely the blueberry matcha with whole milk. it's flavorful and you can definitely taste the blueberry without it overpowering the matcha.

Matchas came out very fast since they are premade and put into a tap, and we got the ham and cheese right away once we ordered at the register.

Went on a Thursday at 11am. Pretty crowded but the line moves pretty fast.

Would come back ! Would be 5/5 if they heated up their pastries.",4 star rating

I really enjoyed the sandwich, the apple flavor was not overwhelming and complimented the flavor well. The tuna was also well-made. The ""side salad"" that is served with the sandwich was also very flavorful and refreshing.
In terms of the drink, some people hate it but some people love it. I don't think the blueberry flavor is thattttt noticeable but it's still a tasty drink.

My friend got the jicama mango chicken salad, and she liked it too. The cafe looked modern and had a good energy. The location is great and I loved sitting outside facing the water fountain. Service was good and there complimentary water, and you can ask for ice. We got there at 12:30pm and waited for about 15 minutes in line. The salad was prepackaged and grab and go which saved time.

1189,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"I got the red bean roti: a baked bun filled with red bean paste and chestnuts and finished with a matcha cookie crust. I was sadly disappointed because the crust barely tasted like matcha. It was there more for beauty because of the vibrant green color than for taste. As for the bread, it wasn't stale but it also didn't seem the freshest either. It was slightly fluffy but it appeared to have the texture of day-old bread rather than fresh bread that I've had at other bakeries. The filling was okay at best. It was a bit dry instead of silky so it stayed in a huge clump in the center.

The plus side is that although the line was out the door, it moved along really quickly since the staff worked quickly. There's a lot of seating outdoors so it seems like a good place to grab a drink and maybe another kind of pastry.",3 star rating

1204,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"My recent breakfast experience at Cafe Dulce in the USC food court was deeply disappointing and frankly, unacceptable. The most glaring issue was the shockingly inconsiderate behavior of the staff. In the middle of our meal, a staff member abruptly took chairs from right under us, forcing us to stand. This rude and disrespectful action compelled us to leave immediately, cutting our visit short.

Additionally, the overall service was remarkably slow, adding to our frustration. During what is usually a busy breakfast time, such inefficiency is particularly noticeable and inconvenient.

The cafe's seating situation was also dismal. Very limited seating was available, and the few spots that were, including the bar counter where we initially found space, were poorly maintained and unclean. The counter was stained and covered in cooking liquids, indicative of a lack of attention to cleanliness.

As for the food, the breakfast burrito I ordered was smaller than expected, which was disappointing. The only redeeming aspect of the visit was the coffee, which was actually quite good. However, this small positive was completely overshadowed by the unpleasant experience caused by the lack of clean seating and the appalling behavior of the staff.

In summary, while the coffee at Cafe Dulce might be commendable, the overall experience was ruined by slow service, inadequate and dirty seating, and, most notably, the disrespectful treatment by the staff. Such behavior is unacceptable in any customer service setting, and it's something that the management at Cafe Dulce needs to address urgently.",1 star rating

My other go to here is the breakfast burrito. It's not great but it's good. Served with soft scrambled eggs, potatoes, spicy mayo, cheeses, salsa, onions with your choice of avo, bacon, or sausage. Since they're made to order, it can take as long as 30 minutes during peak morning times which USC is session or mid morning during the weekends.

For a quick bite, their sandwiches take a shorter time to make or grab a donut, roti or pastry.

This place is a super hip and trendy environment with rap music and other popular songs playing in the store and a group of young staff ready to assist you in ordering.

My order was the blueberry matcha and the pesto chicken sandwhich. The blue berry matcha is honestly addicting. It drinks like a creamy smoothy but it's matcha and blueberry, a super good combo.

Free close street parking or validation in the structure (up to an hour).

Ordered two breakfast burritos (sausage and bacon), two coffees (one Americano and one Joe Pro drip), and green tea donut. The breakfast burritos were reasonable priced for their size (unless you wanted to add avocado for $2.50 extra...bring your own avocado in that case). Super tasty and really enjoyed there was cilantro and tomatoes inside and not just egg, potato, and meat. It was also really soft and creamy tasting and the outside was nicely toasted.

Today I tried the dolce latte w/ oat milk after it was recommended to me by a friend and I wasn't disappointed, it's pretty good, I would say 7.5/10. Not amaaaazingg, but def better than standard. The donut hole wasn't that amazing but for $1, I guess it's a good deal.

I've also tried the cold brew, which kind of tastes like cardboard? And then I also had the viet iced coffee, which was sour. Not hating but worst viet coffee i've had in my life, not crazy horrible though. I wouldn't order any of these again and would only drink them if I was forced to.

I also purchased several donuts/ pastries and everything was divine ! Price point on pastries / donuts approx $3 or $4 each. They have a slightly discounted rate if you buy half a dozen or a full dozen.

Thankfully there is not a location near me- otherwise I'd be there everyday, broke and obese.

They have plenty other goodies that I want to try both from their drink menu and salads. I'm sure l'll be back again.

What we got:
- strawberry cream donut (4.5/5): possibly one of the cutest donuts here and I'm a sucker for anything strawberry. I really liked this donut, but it was just super sweet with both the glaze and buttercream. Overall very delicious and has a nice strawberry flavor. I recommend it!

- chocolate donut (3.5/5): sorta dry but otherwise an okay donut. I'm not the biggest fan of chocolate donuts so this review is sorta biased.

- green tea donut (5/5): I'm a sucker for anything matcha so I was excited for their green tea donut! This one is rolled in sugar and filled with cream. It's not too sweet or overwhelmingly green tea flavored. I find that the slight bitterness of the green tea offsets the sugar coating and cream filling.

1250,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"Ah, Dulce. An integral part of the USC student experience. I've come here countless times to hang out, to study, to catch up with a visiting companion, to grab a refreshing drink to gift to a friend. This is one of those places that every USC student has a standard order at. I'm glad I remembered to check in this time, because its already become such an establishment in USC Village that it's easy to forget it's an independent cafe. Dulce is relatively bougie but still casual; its drinks are high quality and its vibes are hip -- and these elements make it fit comfortably in the Trojan landscape.

My aforementioned go-to order is the blueberry matcha iced latte. Everyone who I've tried it with has loved it. Fruity and earthy all at once, somehow these distinct flavors meld together wonderfully. Another favorite of mine is the Hong Kong Tea Latte. So tantalizingly sweet, and the tea flavor is bold, just how I like it. I also usually get it iced. I'm typically a hot drinks person but there's something impeccable and pristine about the ice at Dulce -- they're perfectly cubic and clear. Of all the things to rave about, yes I am raving about the ice. You can see how much they care about the quality even in their ice cubes!

I LOVE coffee but my go-to orders are non-coffee drinks here because their coffee is a little too much on the bright side for me. I like DARK DARK roasts. But to each their own, this is a taste choice.

The food (as in salads and sandwiches) here I've never tried, but my friends love them. They're beautifully arrayed but the price point is a little too high for me for a lunch between classes especially since there's a TJs across the plaza. The pastries, though, I've had, and they're super yummy! The matcha sesame mochi pastry is a plus. The cakes are good for mini celebrations. And the massive chocolate chip cookies are wonderfully chewy too.

The hipster, yuppily-dressed-and-tatted baristas at this place are all super nice and chill and sometimes even remember you by name.

I was very excited about my blueberry matcha but had no idea they had such a variety of pastries and donuts too. We had other stops to make afterward, otherwise I would've stocked up on donuts here! I wanted to try one thing at least, so I took the cashier's recommendation for the cream cheese roti bun. He was very helpful in explaining all their pastry offerings since none of them were labeled. I liked the filling inside of the one I got but the outside is definitely a crisper texture than I prefer.

The blueberry matcha latte met all my expectations. It was blended nicely and rich in both blueberry and matcha flavors. My husband's Vietnamese coffee wasn't a winner though - it tasted like a nitro latte. A good drink but just not quite like Vietnamese coffee at all.

Each of our meals costs about $10 which is a bit high for a breakfast meal, but before I go quick to judgment, I knew I had to taste it myself.

My breakfast burrito was actually really good. Chunks of sausage inside a soft tortilla bundles with plenty of cheese, tomato, potatoes, and eggs. They slice the burrito in half which made it easy to enjoy while driving to LAX. Unlike other cafes, you can choose either bacon, sausage, or avocado as the premium base in the burrito.

There were so many choices, which made it hard to choose. I chose to tae a chance with the bacon donut hole. Also the coffee donut. My mom went with a slice of Tiramisu cake. When I tasted my donuts let's just say I was beyond impressed. I have NEVER taste a donut that's as soft as cake. The dough to most donuts become a bit hard which causes most to turn to the icing for that complete satisfaction. Not dulce!!!

1296,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"Dulce's prime location and USC reputation keep it busy as the go-to spot for work, coffee chats, and casual mornings with friends.

The staff is always incredibly friendly despite how busy it is all the time! There's always a line, but most of the time it's pretty short. The food and drinks are always pretty good.

Highlights:
- Best breakfast burrito in a 20 mile radius. The potatoes are almost mashed, drizzled with a sauce with a bit of heat, and melted with cheese into scrambled eggs so soft you could sleep on them.
- Their triple berry cake is springy and light, fruit and cream reminiscient of a day in a strawberry field.
- Blueberry matcha latte is a classic, fun and subtle twist on something everyone's done.

Dulce also has its own identity separate from the waves of pastry and coffee shops bobbing across LA. The founder (a USC alum) notes that they wanted to stay to their niche. It's better to do one thing well than to do many things halfway, something represented in menu choices like the matcha roti and lack of avocado toast.

It's definitely worth a try though. The mocha roti was crunchy yet soft! Wasn't overly sweet so I didn't feel gross after eating it. Their breakfast burrito is wrapped perfectly so nothing falls out!

They play music and with all the people chatting, it can get really loud and hard to hear. When I asked about the kinds of chai lattes they had, I was told that if I ordered my chai latte iced, I couldn't change the milk option (I'm not sure how true this is because I was having a hard time hearing so I just said okay). I usually get oat milk, but this drink was made with whole milk which upset my stomach a few hours later. I also ordered a breakfast burrito which I waited 15-20 minutes for, but it was worth it. Great, big, filling size and made fresh from the kitchen. A few days later I came back and ordered the blueberry matcha (this time with oat milk) and a chocolate croissant (which may be pricey but it is a large croissant). That order was delicious. I would definitely go again. Also all the pastries look so good, except sometimes there are flies sitting on them...

1304,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"Dulce for me is a hit or miss. Love, love, love a pillowtop latte from here. The pillow top is a sort of sea cream, and it's my favorite one that I've had. However half the time that I come they are out of the pillow top.

I also particularly love the strawberry cream donut, the cream is really fresh and the sweetness is well-balanced. I've also tried their Oreo donut and it was overly sweet and not good to me at all.

For me, the other drink menu items are kind of underwhelming. Unlike other reviewers, I was not a huge fan of their matcha drinks. The blueberry matcha had too much of an artificial, almost medicinal berry flavor to it, and the regular matcha didn't really taste quality to me. The lattes are good, better than Starbucks by far but in my opinion not up to par with other LA coffee joints like Blue Bottle. I found the dulce latte too sweet for my taste. The Vietnamese coffee was too unbalanced with how strong it was, I've had better ones picked up from my local pho spot (though admittedly I've never had a Vietnamese coffee from a coffee shop that I thought was better than a hole in the wall Vietnamese restaurant.)

What really makes this location 3 stars instead of 4 for me is that I have had issues with the customer service at this particular location. I don't expect much when it comes to customer service; all I really want is some basic politeness, but I have had unpleasant interactions here enough times for me to make note of it.

I took on a temp position with USC due to covid times and I find myself here amongst these gifted students. They all have their Dulces coffee cups, foo foo drinks, food and deserts. I drank the Kool aid and now I find myself indulging in their greatness!!

Harry and his supervisor are my heroes. I think the supervisor is young, Asian thin and typically wears a beaded eyeglass leash/croakie. Forgive me for forgetting his name. UGH

So tonight I finally caved in and indulged in their Dulce latte and a snow capped roti bun. It was a very chilly night tonight and so a hot drink and desert was well in need. I'm forever going to thank Harry for the recommendation. ""Can I get an Amen!!!! Hallelujah! Out of this world bun. Sooo delicious. It was a mild sweet bun with cream cheese filling inside, just the right amount. Tasted almost like a Mexican pan dulce called concha.but this was like a cuisine bun. Soo moist and delicious. The topping was slight crunchy, it crumbled, and yes I ate the crumbles. You won't be disappointed.

As for the dulce latte, its not overly sweet and with a nice flavor I can't put my finger on it. Can't wait to come back and sample the tiramisu and red bean roti bun that was recommended by my co-worker and one of the students.

I don't drink coffee but I've tried the iced Dulce latte here which might be the only thing that will ever make me drink coffee. If you're a drink person, you'll love this.

Also, the Spicy Korean Cheesesteak is a hidden gem on their menu. It's like a bulgogi sandwich with a kick.

The Asian chicken salad is delicious and has a light dressing to it that I really enjoy and feel healthy for eating afterwards. Sandwiches are also a great option as well as the breakfast burritos.

Prices are reasonable, except the desserts lol which is almost a price of a meal. The desserts took tasty but I've refrained from buying them since they are on the pricier side.

Bakery: I'm not a huge fan of their bakery section, but they have a variety of unique treats~
- The roti's aren't that great in my opinion as there's lots of cream inside that's not flavored to my liking (it was too thick for me).
- The brick toasts are fresh, fluffy on the inside, and crispy on the outside! These weren't overly sweet~
- I *definitely* recommend the Dino churros!!! A friend recommended this to me and I never thought to try it since it looks plain looking. Well, I was pleasantly surprised by it. These are basically soft, chewy fried bread with sugar all around. There's no cream inside (which is great for me). But, hey try 'em next time!

Drinks: Their matcha bar is solid. My favorite is their regular iced matcha latte. I actually don't really like the blueberry matcha as the drink was too sweet for me and it felt artificial... (I don't have the American sweet tooth so I'm quite sensitive to sweet drinks FYI)

Food: I can only comment on the sandwiches. I grew up eating Chinese food so I'm used to eating salty/oily dishes. The Pesto Chicken and Dulce Club are always my go to food for lunch. It wasn't ""greasy"" for me as other Yelpers have said. The baguette was toasted nicely and flavors of the fillings worked really well together. They're not stingy with the avocado in Pesto Chicken.

In my experience since then, the issues I've seen before have been fixed, and all of my visits have been enjoyable. They really care about their customers, and they're very transparent about everything they do.

Now onto the drinks - I would definitely recommend a cold brew if you're tired and need something refreshing to pick you up. This is one of my go-tos right before my long 7 hour class days. Their dulce latte is a bit on the sweeter side, but it's also pretty delicious and satisfying. If you're in the mood for matcha, I would definitely give the blueberry matcha latte a try! I've tried the pastries a couple times, but they were only average to me. The drinks here are what make the place stand out for me!

It had a super thin layer of chocolate glaze on top ( which I asked myself . . . why even bother to put any chocolate , when you can barely taste it)!

The cake slices ( 3/Berry Cake which seems to have a take on sweet lady Jane , nowhere near in taste or texture. The Trinity Chocolate Cake , 3/ layers of various chocolate flavor which had a ( mousse type filling) also unfortunately the cake falls extremely short on taste because of the flavor profile on the white & chocolate cake bread ( NONE! ! ! )but moderately price for a good size serving. A lot of the Asian bakeries whether in Alhambra, West Covina , Little Tokyo,, and other surrounding locations do not make their desserts super sweet and I understand that, because that's just how they make them ...a lot of sugar does not play a dominant role in their cakes & pastries, But they can make them where there is texture and taste, and Cafe Dulce didn't deliver on those accounts for me.",1 star rating

Food Recommendations!
I am seriously surprised at how amazing the food is from this coffee shop! They are mostly known for their donuts and pastries along with their exquisite coffee! But I seriously recommend you to try out their food menu!
+ pastrami sandwich (my favorite!) it comes with a side salad
+ breakfast burrito or sandwich (I get it almost every time! I can literally just drink up their salsa! What's in that thing?)
+ kale salad (I know right? I hate kale.. I never eat it.. but I am surprised how edible AND delicious their kale salad is.. makes me feel healthy!)

They have a different menu for their ""lunch / dinner"" options! I've tried their burger and fries! They are actually REALLY good... never thought I would be going to a coffee shop for a good hearty burger, but it really hits the spot!

Drink Recommendations
+ iced blueberry matcha... i know it sounds weird... but its actually a hidden gem and completely addicting!
+ dulce latte ... I haven't met one person that didn't like this one
+ hong kong milk tea - it tastes a little richer than the usual milk tea I get from boba places

Before the USC Village popped up, the biggest thing that students wanted was a nice coffee shop to hang out at. Dulce provides that and so much more. Yes, there can be a line sometime, but it moves pretty fast and the service is extremely friendly.

I've had a lot of things from here, but below are some highlights:

- Iced Matcha Latte w/ Oat Milk: as good as any matcha latte in the area! Their blueberry one is good too but I personally prefer the regular.
- Iced Latte w/ Oat Milk: What I get when I need some caffeine. Good but pretty standard
- Guava Cheese Pastry: the best pastry here IMO. Delicious but not too sweet. They're sometimes sold out of these, so if you want one try to go earlier in the day!
- Breakfast burrito: SO GOOD. They've raised the price of these recently but I think it's still worth it. I typically get it with sausage and add avocado. It's dank but also not as heavy as some breakfast burritos out there. Highly, highly recommend.

It can get pretty crowded inside, but the outdoor area is really nice if you can snag a table.

Food:
Brick Toast, Original Roti (or Snow Cap Roti). The desserts are all so good but you can't go wrong with the rotis, they have I think 5-6 different flavors!

In terms of the cafe itself, it does tend to get quite crowded and loud so it's not a good place for studying or more quiet conversations.

1396,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"This is my all time favorite coffee shop in the USC/Downtown LA area. Whether you're near the USC Village and looking for a refreshing drink, a satisfying bite, or a productive study spot, Cafe Dulce has all that you need! The staff are extremely friendly and gracious, and the drinks are out of this world. My favorite drink is the iced Matcha Latte which has a strong matcha flavor -- they don't skimp on the matcha. If I'm looking for something with no sugar, my go-to is an iced almond milk latte. Whatever you find yourself at Dulce for, you'll leave in a daze of productivity and good vibes from the tasty drinks and food, cool staff, and great music.

For Covid-19, they have fantastic social distancing measures in place with a table at the door to serve you. Everyone is wearing masks, and I wasn't worried at all when I visited recently to get my latte and croissant.",5 star rating

Every drink I've tried has been awesome but I recommend their Hong Kong milk tea or their Matcha Blueberry latte. Both are super refreshing and not overwhelmingly sweet. The blueberry is a nice twist on a traditional matcha latte and I love it!

Donuts are bomb here so definitely get one when you stop by! I like the strawberry jam donut the most. Their croissants are surprisingly really good as well. You honestly can't go wrong with any of their pastries tbh

Lots of seating but it can get pretty busy. I'm not sure how their wifi is because it's close enough to just use USC's wifi so I just do that lol

1399,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"Dulce puts the ""hot"" in hot & new and is overall a prime addition to the USC Village! With reasonable prices, high-quality drinks, and yummy pastries, this place is going to be a BIG hit very soon, if not already. It's a shame that they had their opening date so close to finals (where students are home for the holidays), but it seems like they're doing super well for a new place.

What I've gotten so far:
- Blueberry Matcha Latte with soy: Highly recommend - it's delicious and sweet! If you LOVE sweet drinks, matcha and fruity pebbles...this is the drink for you.
- Cold brew: SUPER smooth and slightly sweetened. My favorite part? It's so affordable!
- Bacon donut hole: Simple and yum! Also, there's bacon...'nough said.
***Can't wait to try everything else!!! Will update once I do.

I've got to say, though, that considering Dulce is right by the main USC campus, it's preeettty loud here for students to study. It seems to get REALLY busy, and you can hear all the machines at once.

Service is fast and friendly. The staff seem to be knowledgeable, passionate, and very helpful in explaining what is in their drinks and pastries, etc.

If you are visiting from out of town: there is limited street parking, but they do validate for one hour for the parking structure underground.

1400,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"It is very rare for me to write a bad review, and I don't recall to have written one on Yelp! We would want to like Dulce based on some positive comments on here and the nice decor they have. We gave it a try the other day and had a horrible experience.

I took my friend there for early causal dinner, it was the first time for both of us coming to Dulce. We grabbed the menu and trying to figure it out what to order by the corner as you need to make and pay for your order at cashier before you sit down for a meal here.
English is my friend's second language, she just moved to America. It took her some time to look at the menu and decided what to order. A dark hair female asian looking cashier asked us twice and rushed us to order, we told her that we were not ready. ( Sorry if it might sound racist to some. The fact is that we are both asians as well, the attitude of this cashier towards my friend was very disrespectful and made her feeling that she was being be-little. I honestly don't think it was right! That's why I had to point it out )

Due to the holidays, there are not much people at the cafe nor no line to purchase to be honest. However, She got very annoyed and had a bad attitude. She even whispered to her co-worker and then ""warned"" us if we don't order right at that moment, they will close in 10 mins. We then checked their business hours when we left the cafe. It was actually a lie !

Shortly after, her attitude changed 360 dramatically when a male customer came by. For whatever reason it could be, it is not acceptable unfortunately.

I don't recommend this place at all, customer service is important! It doesn't matter how nice you decor your cafe or what kind of food you serve. We will never go back to this place again!",1 star rating

I am not a big dairy milk drinker and the condensed milk that they use for their latte had a really strong taste to it which was not as enjoyable to me.

Situated right at USC, it's no wonder how popular Dulce is for hanging out, studying, and whatever. Their matcha latte is always a soothing drink and their bacon bit donut is worth trying once (though once is probably enough unless you breathe, live, and eat bacon).

I had ordered a Dulce Latte (having never tried it before) with oat milk (because I'm lactose intolerant).

When I got my drink, I took a sip and discovered it was a lot sweeter than I thought it would be, so I was hoping they could to top it off with more oat milk to balance out the sweetness.

When I asked, I was told by the woman behind the counter that she had seen me take a drink of it already and I can't get any extra oat milk. In my opinion, her tone seemed sharp (maybe it was because of the busy crowd and she was feeling flustered).

I tried to explain to her that I was simply hoping to balance it out because it's sweeter than I thought it would be.

She told me that if I don't like the sweetness level, I can make that clear when I order the drink and they'll put less syrup into it.

I guess she expected me to somehow know the sweetness level before I had ever actually tried it. Seems unreasonable, but maybe I'm the unreasonable one ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I don't think I am, though.

It's just a little extra oat milk, I think I had a sensible reason for wanting to get it topped off, no reason to be sharp with me.

In any case, I left feeling confused and the experience was just unpleasant enough to make me think twice before going back to Dulce or recommending it to any friends.

He asked if I liked coffee or tea; I'm more of a tea guy. So he recommended their Matcha Iced Tea. I've only had green tea once before and I didn't really enjoy it. But I was willing to give it a 2nd chance. So I got their Matcha Tea.

The service is fast. Got my donuts as soon as I orderes them and my tea came about a minute after. There were open seats, luckily. Usually the place is packed. I sat down and enjoyed my donuts and tea. The Matcha tea was really good. It felt refreshing as well.

Value of food was good in the sense that ingredients and amount of food was good for its price. Service was very slow, though the workers there were very friendly. The taste wasn't as good as I expected, but it's still acceptable for a simple meal, though it's not something I would crave. I got the pesto chicken sandwich and it was very salty and greasy, though there was a lot of ingredients (such as avocado) that made it a healthy balanced meal. But the tastes didn't blend together as smoothly as high quality sandwiches do.

My friend got a matcha latte there (they have milk alternatives!!) and it tasted really good (probably better than Starbucks), so definitely a short drop-by drink spot, especially since they serve drinks 10 times faster than they do food.

I had a strawberry cream donut and an iced blueberry matcha latte. The donut was EXCELLENT but now that I've had their chocolate cream donut at their other location it's now demoted to my second fave. Their donut dough is perfection--light and rich at the same time if that makes any sense.

The latte was unique. Even tho the blueberry flavor was very artificial tasting, their was something really addicting about it. I ordered it with light ice, and my cup was delivered short about an inch. Kinda petty IMO considering that this drink is +$5.

The cafe is known for its matcha lattes. Highly recommend it hot, with oat milk (an extra 75 cents). If you ask for it unsweetened, they'll charge you for the Premium matcha, which costs even more.
Now that they have a new supplier of oat milk, they no longer run out at the beginning of each week (this had happened for a couple of weeks earlier this year).

If you like your drinks hot, then definitely get it *extra hot* at this location. If you don't, in my experience, the hot drinks always come out warm. And even when I've asked for it extra hot, there have been multiple times where it still came out lukewarm.

1451,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"I've been here as well as the little Tokyo location quite a few times as it's conveniently on the way to the USC campus. The whole setup is great. Plenty of outside seating and inside seating with a bar overlooking the operation. Different from Little Tokyo location with a more modern feel.

The drinks are top shelf. Matcha latte is good as well as blueberry matcha latte if you're looking for a bit sweeter. Milk tea is light and satisfying although nothing too surprising. Food is quick and OKAY. Jambon de Paris does indeed remind me of my time living in Paris, although this is where my bad experiences here start:

There is both spread and spicy mustard on the sandwich. I like more mayo but also like a slight kick so I ask for extra mayo (and leave the mustard the same amount). I've gotten multiple different responses: we don't have mayo at all. We only have spicy mayo. It's only mustard on there. One time I forgot to ask for extra and went up and asked for a side of it. They said ""we don't give out sides"". Wtf. Why not? That's the stupid thing I've ever heard. After a 5 minute argument, curly haired manager, came over and was like sure here ya go (the only one working there who seems to get it). So easy.

Then today I got an order for here, sat outside with my dog, and we waited for our food and drink. I KNOW that drinks are at the bar. I've been a barista as well as a server. But I have my dog and all my stuff and it seems to me it's not that difficult to bring the drink out with ONE plate. I tell this Asian girl (prob a manager too doesn't matter) that I haven't got my drink yet. She tells me ""it's actually inside at the bar"" (I knew that). This would've been the time to swallow your pride and take 5 seconds to bring it out for me. ESPECIALLY if i spend $20 on a meal and tip you 15% every time I come in. I also go to Nature's Brew down the street and it's 100% better service.

Also the breakfast is awful. I'll be back though cause my dog likes the village. Hope it's not awkward lol",3 star rating

I usually order either the hot or cold americano, which is always prepared just right. My wife on the other hand is more of a sweet drink person. And she loves the Hong Kong milk tea here, which has a more vibrant tea flavor than the usual milk teas. Occasionally we order the dinosaur churros with our drinks. It's not too sweet and has a dense but chewy texture that is really satisfying. It also perfectly complements our drinks. The staff are professional and efficient, although not the most kindest. So I will definitely be returning here regularly for my coffee needs from time to time.",4 star rating
1453,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"TLDR: Really unique drink and pastry flavors, a bit on the pricey side but always my go to treat-myself-pickmeup spot near USC! Download 5-stars if you come here often, they have rewards for free drinks, desserts, and food!

- Taste: I've come here way too many times in this life, and have tried a good amount of the drinks on the menu. But my usual go-to is the regular sized, iced blueberry matcha latte with oat milk. If you love matcha, you just have to try this drink there is nothing like it anywhere else! If I'm craving a hot drink, my go-to would be the hot rose milk tea. Some other drinks I'd recommend: Dulce Latte and Hong Kong Milk tea.
- Portion Size: The drink comes with a lot of ice, and you can't really adjust it unless you pay more. But pretty standard size for a latte.
- Price: On the pricier side, my regular sized blueberry matcha latte + oat milk comes out to $6.25, but that is pretty comparable to the cafes I go to in Ktown.
- Service: I tend to go at night, and they are fast and efficient with making drinks! If you come around noon time in the day though the lines will be out the door.
- Ambiance: There is not too much seating inside but there are some tables outside! The cafe is cute and well decorated, but I rarely come here to study because the music is a bit loud.

The service was okay, not bad but not memorable.

I had been craving matcha and when I saw the Blueberry Matcha Latte I knew I wanted to try that.

A large, 16 ounces, was $5.95 and I think a little too expensive at that price. But thankfully it was really good.

They seem to keep their matcha and milk ready to pour already mixed together. I'm not sure what the blueberry flavor is whether a syrup or something else but it balances really well with the matcha flavor, neither over powering the other.

They have a wonderful selection of beans sourced from around the world. The pastries are always mouthwatering fresh; I think they use a secret ingredient called ""care"" in everything they serve. It's also a great place to chowdown on breakfast or lunch, the price points are reasonable and the food is quite tasty. The two hour parking validation is a bonus.

Here on a work trip from the Bay Area. Found this place after exploring the area a bit and was pleasantly surprised by the large variety of foods and drinks! Having been here for a few days already I haven't seen very many matcha/green tea options so I was very glad that I was able to begin my day with a mouthwatering matcha morning! As someone that really likes the taste of matcha I think the amount whole milk overpowered the matcha just a smidge.

The prices are what you'd expect at a trendy LA coffee/pastries place, and honestly, most hover around the same price point as similar Starbucks items; I'd take Dulce over Starbucks any day, so I'm pretty happy with what I paid!

1466,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"Dulce is basically a nice break from seeing 5,000 Starbucks around USC. Goodness

Located at the USC and in Little Tokyo, this is a super cute place. White table tops with wooden finishes and cool artwork around the shop. A great place for talking with friends over some food and coffee or grab your laptop and get some studying done with your favorite latte.

I came here twice in one day. Once for their boxed salads and another for their drink. The menu selection is pretty great! It's simple, but there are definitely a lot of options for those who like coffee and for those who are pretty sensitive to coffee. They also have milk tea drinks, which is really great and makes this coffee shop really unique. The food selection is pretty spectacular. From delectable pastries displayed in a glass box to get your sweet tooth going and for those cheat days, to your various selection of sandwiches and salads at affordable prices.

I got their Asian Chicken salad and their matcha tea later in the day. The Asian Chicken salad was super tasty! The dressing is not salty, and it adds a nice touch to the salad. Quality wise, it was definitely great. The matcha tea is very refreshing, and it has no sugar in it so you'll fully get the matcha taste. Matcha has mad benefits, so please get yourself to try some! :)

Study place wise, this place is a little popping in terms of their music. BUT! I will say that the spacious, clean cafe will make anyone want to come chill here and get some work done. WiFi needs some improvements, as their WiFi is pretty spotty. But I think because they just opened, this is probably an adjustment they can easily make.

Service wise, wow! Talk about friendliness/professionalism! I can tell that the staff love it here, for its chill vibes and amazing coffee. They also seem to have a great relationship with each other, which is manifested by the way their service is. As someone who loves coffee shops, they really do make this place pleasant and enjoyable!

Parking is at the USC Village. First hour is free, but the parking rate is high! Try finding street parking or get validation from Trader Joe's or Target

1504,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,Really popular spot for USC students and members of the local community!! The cafe is situated in the middle of the USC village and is always buzzing with energy! The place has really generous hours of operation which means you can come here for your early morning coffee or for a late night study session. I came for the opening where I tried the dulce latte (with condensed milk) and a couple of their donuts. Since then its been my go to place and I love getting either the matcha latte or vietnamese latte with a brick toast or bacon donut for breakfast! Their baguettes are also great and come with a side salad for lunch. Great atmosphere inside with a well thought out interior. I love the feature wall too (pictured below).

1506,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"For a cafe that prides itself on having ""a positive impact simply by how [they] serve people"", Cafe Dulce needs to re-assess its current team of frontline cashiers and baristas. The actions and attitudes of some Dulce employees towards service are not at all consistent with this mission statement. Here's a little recount of my experience here.

All I wanted was an iced tea. I guess I couldn't count on the cashier to warn me that certain teas are only served hot. I especially shouldn't have expected her to confirm with me that the drink I chose was going to be a hot drink. Seriously, these are the kind of people that would put milk in your green tea by default when you didn't ask for milk at all.

Anyway, once I realized I was getting a ridiculously hot drink when temperatures outside are in the high 80s, I asked the dude with glasses who served me to change it to an iced drink. ""Oh, we don't do that,"" he said, not showing an ounce of concern. Okay, thanks dude. So I asked if I could at least have a cup of ice, and then I was left pouring the tea myself. At this point, I was getting agitated. I might as well have just made my own tea at home.

I had to flag down another employee to ask her what the difference was in turning the hot tea into an iced tea, and why they couldn't just have done that for me. She gave me an answer that I can respect but am still not satisfied with: that they're not legally allowed to pour hot tea into a plastic cup because it releases a whole host of carcinogens into the drink.

I'm just not satisfied because I'm well aware that, for other drinks, they use shakers made of metal, which are entirely capable of turning a hot liquid into an iced drink. That I had to make such an effort to receive some kind of explanation or accommodation just killed any desire I had to be a paying and tipping customer at Dulce.

But other than the subpar service - the lukewarm tea that I ended up with? Not bad. This is the end of my Dulce rant. 3 star deduction because I really don't think Dulce should hold a 4 1/2 star rating.",2 star rating

1510,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"This used to be one of our favorite spots to start our day out in LA! Not sure what has happened but lately some of the employees have a little attitude.

Aside from a different experience we had a month ago, I decided to give it another try as we LOVE the Dulce Latte! My boyfriend ended up trying the Vietnamese coffee today, I stuck with the Dulce Latte. As to be expected my Dulce Latte was great, the Vietnamese was too sweet! Couldn't taste the coffee!
We ate inside and after we were done we went back out and waited in line. 10mins. We reached the register again and asked if we could have a new drink but less sweet as this one was overpowered by condensed milk. She said no they can't adjust the sweetness so we asked if we could switch it for a Dulce Latte instead. The girl did not understand and was charging us. Okay at the point we'll pay. Whatever. The girl next to her told us that they CAN exchange it, we just needed to go to the counter where the drinks are given and let them know we want to exchange and they would do it.

We go. We explain to another girl that the Vietnamese was too sweet and we asked the front if we could just switch it and get the Dulce Latte. She said no ""we don't do that"".

Okay? The Vietnamese coffee was full. It's not like we drank half and then decided to get a new one!

So as I tried explaining that the girl at the register was the one who told us to come here and exchange it she walked away.
She came back and said they would do it but they don't do modifications.

I'm sorry. But as a coffee & tea lover I have NEVER experienced this at any other coffee shop!

Not to mention, the prior incident was with two employees, one which he seemed very impatient at the registered and seemingly rushing us to finish our order.

The next was the guy making our drinks. One was asked to be made with almond milk. When I went up to get our drinks I asked which one had the almond milk and he said honestly I forgot. And when asked ""wait? Okay, you forgot?"" He gave me a blank stare and said yeah. I think it's this one.

I'm sorry, but how is that acceptable?

I bet they don't care much or non at all about their unsatisfactory reviews so just a warning for any future customers.",1 star rating
1511,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"In my opinion, one of the best places to get work done on campus. Located in the University Village, it's just a short walk away from many of the residential areas for students. They have so many amazing desserts, but my favorites are still their drinks. The matcha latte and hong kong milk tea are by far some of their best. Their lunch sandwiches are also pretty amazing and just the perfect size so you'll be left satisfied. Don't be shocked by the extremely long lines at lunch. It's usually out the door during noon on weekdays but they move through surprisingly quickly and always manage to get you your coffee fix with only a little wait. There are weekends where my friends and I will come and find a seat in their outdoor seating area and get some coffee to work on our assignments or study for midterms for hours. It cam get very busy and a bit loud but I don't mind it. I tend to like studying with music. To me, its the perfect place right on campus.

I liked how how it was perfectly sweet (not overly sweet like most donuts are for me). But, the actual dough and chocolate flavor was lacking in my personal opinion. I also tried the matcha roti which honestly was disappointing. It tasted like nothing.

I had a Dulce Latte as well and unfortunately it tasted watered down. It tasted of hot, bitter water with cream. Hardly any coffee bean flavor. I gave it a second chance in another visit just in case mine was made poorly/it was a bad batch. But nope, it was the same. Honestly, I found Starbucks to be more flavorful.

On a good note, though, I tried their gen mai tea latte and that was pretty delicious.

1518,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"The reviews are correct that the food and drinks are delicious and high quality at Dulce - I've been coming here for two years and it seems over the summer vs Fall/Spring there are different rules. I understand price increases to keep up with inflation, but once school semesters start they charge for ""no ice"". In the cold drinks, if you ask for no ice, they will charge extra for the 1/4 drink that is missing. With price increases, this rule shouldn't be in place, especially when you're paying now $5 (on avg) for 3/4 of a cup of coffee/tea. AND have to pay $1 extra to fill it up to the top. I do love the place and have brought friends here, but with this ""no ice, increase price"" rule, I would say it is worth ordering the hot drinks over the iced drinks. At least at Starbucks you pay a similar amount, can ask for no ice, and have no price increase.",3 star rating

1525,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"As a USC student who has witnessed the changing neighborhood for 4 years, it is refreshing to finally see a locally owned coffee shop open up. We have a total of six Starbucks establishments near USC. Unlike all of them, Dulce serves quality coffee with quality ingredients (real matcha powder, real almond milk). Albeit a bit more expensive, I know I'm supporting a local business and receiving top-notch coffee. I usually go to K-town to study at cafes but Dulce offers the same atmosphere within walking distance of campus.

STUDY/ WORK: It's not an ideal study environment for everyone. Yes, the music can be loud but I don't mind the commotion while I study, esp good music like Noname. My only gripe is the lack of outlets- sit at the bar to charge or come pre-charged. Seating can be limited inside but there's plenty outside in the USC Village. Use USC wifi or their private network.

DRINKS/ FOOD: For a serious caffeine kick, get their Vietnamese Iced Coffee. Dulce latte and matcha (blueberry) latte seem to be their most popular drinks ($3-$5). Donuts are yummy - try the matcha roti, matcha donut or bacon donut ($2-$3). Haven't tried their meals ($8-10), but the salads and breakfast burritos look bomb. Similar to their Little Tokyo location but more modern (check out the beautiful mural painted by Yoskay Yamamoto). Worth spending $5 for a drink if I can study there for hours. I heard they'll be serving alcohol soon too...

SERVICE: Employees are silly, fun and friendly. They'll dance to the music while making your lattes and even gave me samples of a new tea they're experimenting with. Parking can be validated for an hour in the USC Village parking structure, otherwise street parking is available.

But the menu is so limited and even the things they have on there they don't do well. The matcha blueberry latte which they're known for is overpriced and wayyy too sweet, and the breakfast sandwich and apple tuna sandwich are so lackluster and disappointing. To the owners of this establishment I recommend putting more effort into your menu as you do with your pastries, and spicy mayo on a tuna melt just doesn't work. Also please offer more non dairy milks with your teas!! I'm specifically hinting at the chai tea and blueberry matcha to be offered with oat or almond milk instead of whole milk, it just overpowers the flavor.",3 star rating
1528,https://www.yelp.com/biz/dulce-los-angeles,"What is all the hype about? I was excited to try Dulce, having heard so many positive things about it but was greatly disappointed.

Long story short: I ordered a cappuccino and got a latte. Maybe the barista was more interested in making some latte art than producing actual milk foam. Another customer got a 'latte' and apart from her drink being served in a larger cup - duh since a latte actually requires steamed milk whereas a cappuccino requires milk FOAM - my beverage didn't seem any different from a flat white. So I asked the barista: this is a cappuccino? Where's the foam? Barista: 'oh I may not have made it as foamy as it should be. Sorry.' um what?! You were just going to trick me into believing that this is a cappuccino? She wanted to make me a new drink (at least she admits it wasn't a cappuccino) but I didn't bother.
The taste? Sorry... but my ahem 'cappuccino' tasted like ground beans that were roasted too quickly at a temperature that was too high - burnt. Maybe some people like it this way but this is the first time I would actually prefer a cappuccino from Starbucks.

I didn't realize that they also have a location in Little Tokyo, which is why this place sounded familiar when I first saw it. I decided to order a Green Tea Roti, which was described as a bread like pastry with a cookie like top layer and cream in the middle. This pastry was around $3-$4, and is a pretty large size. I debated on getting a coffee to go with my pastry, but with coffees being around $5, which I guess is pretty standard-I decided that I didn't feel like spending around $10 for a coffee and pastry and decided to get a coffee another time. I thought the Roti was honestly just okay. I don't think I would order it again. It's too heavy, and in my opinion not delicious enough for all that extra weight. My friend got the hong kong milk tea, and said it was pretty good, but that she also noticed that it was poured from some kind of pitcher, which made it seem like it had been pre-made. For around $5 a drink, I wouldn't want something pre-made. I'll need to come back, and try the coffee for myself.

You scan the QR code and order and pay on the site.
It's cool because everyone scans and you can see what everyone has added on the cart for check out.

A large open restaurant with plenty of indoor seating. The tables are arranged in a way where you can definitely seat a large party if you have one. Also, I like that they have a coffee machine inside.

Food: 4/5
Solid Chinese food spot. The food will definitely satisfy your Chinese food craving, but it isn't anything special. The flavors are muted compared to other Chinese food restaurants, but the food is decently seasoned with a nice balance of sodium and spice. There's not a lot of vegetarian options, but I would recommend the Veggie Noodles if you need one. This dish is similar to vegetarian chow mein and makes a decent meal.

Service: 5/5
The staff here are very nice and helpful. The food is ready within 10-15 minutes so very quick service. When you finish your meal, you go up to the counter to pay.",5 star rating

1575,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-street-food-los-angeles-4,"Service: Awful
-- We were greeted with this girl with an attitude and she had it the entire time we were there. I understand cultural differences, but my god was this one girl so rude to us the entire time. She was dismissive, rolled her eyes, and couldn't manage an ounce of empathy (we will return to this).

Ambiance: Meh
-- The tables were so close together that I was basically eating at an elementary school cafeteria. The wait staff were not any better because (especially the girl) was dismissive and rude.

Food: Slightly better than bad, but not good
-- We ordered the fried beef noodles and bean with sesame sauce. Mind you, nothing on their online ordering menu talks about allergens and the modification button appears so quickly that you don't even notice it until it's gone. You can't really even order in person because they have everything through their website. The noodles were cold, but decent but my issue is with the beans with sesame sauce. I took one bite from the beans with sesame sauce and noticed the very prevalent peanut flavor. I am quite literally deathly allergic to peanuts. My friend had called the waitress over and asked what was in the beans with sesame sauce and the waitress confirmed that there were peanuts in the sauce. My friend was explaining that I am very allergic to peanuts and the waitress stared at me with such annoyance that I wished I had peeled over and died. She dismissed my allergy, took the food, and took it off the bill, but there was no apology, no trying to make things better, not even help. So yea, after washing my mouth with mouth wash (why they have mouth wash I'm not sure, but I'm really glad it was there), taking a couple benadryls, and monitored my symptoms, we were about to leave when I saw that we were still being charged for our lunch. Did I expect to pay after the restaurant neglected any allergen protocols and almost killed me, no quite frankly. But there I was, arguing with the once again rude waitress who said that we only paid for rice instead of the whole meal. Last I checked, rice isn't $25, but sure okay. I am deeply disappointed by my entire experience and I hope no one else experiences the same as I did.",1 star rating
1576,https://www.yelp.com/biz/chinese-street-food-los-angeles-4,"Chinese Street Food is at the USC Village which means the demographics for the restaurant should be mostly students however if you look at the prices here, it is definitely not for students unless their pockets run deep. The price for the food is on par with most higher tier restaurants, you're talking almost 20 dollars per entree. I don't know what kind of ""street food"" is 20 dollars.

The food itself is mediocre, ordered a couple of items like the cucumber salad, orange chicken, and pickled fish filet. The cucumber salad is just... cucumber cut up. There's nothing really special about it, no garlic, no special seasoning. If I wanted to eat cucumber by itself I would not have ordered a ""cucumber salad"". The orange chicken is very meh, small portions and Panda Express does it so much better. It's all kinda lumpy and stuck together. For 17.99, it better be better than Panda Express. The pickled fish filet didn't have much filet, mostly soup.

The kicker is even for these high prices, you don't even get free rice. That's in addition to the high price tag of the entree. If I wanted to pay 20 dollars a dish I would had gone to a place like Meizhou DongPo at lease the food there is worth the 20 dollars a dish.

The interior is nicely decorated though, the restrooms stink pretty bad. As you approach the restroom, it smells!

The parking for this place is relatively easy, if you go during normal hours, you can park in the underground parking structure. This place opens late and you'll have to park on the side of the street if you eat late.

There isn't much service either, they bring you your food but water is self served.

Overall, over priced Chinese food not worth the price. No service as it's a lot of self serve. Portions aren't large either.",2 star rating

The lady behind the counter was very sweet and offered to give me a free drink in exchange for a five star yelp review, I was tempted to oblige, however I was absolutely disgusted to see one of the cooks sampling food from the to-go orders. This gentleman literally picked food out of the plastic container, popped it in his mouth, and went right back to work without washing his hands. It occurred to me that we're still in a pandemic, which made me realize they should probably wear masks in the kitchen, if not at the very least be washing their hands frequently since they are preparing food for customers to consume.

She said it reminded her of back home.

Food was good but I have to write a poor review because I was double charged on my credit card haven't been able to contact anyone to get the transaction reversed.

The restaurant uses QR codes on their tables to order items and pay the bill. However, I had a large party seated across two tables next to each other. As mentioned before, food and service was good, when the time came to pay the bill I scanned and paid via the QR code - about 80% of the bill and I was moving to scan the 2nd code to pay the remaining balance. While doing this, the cashier presented a total bill to us and had disabled the online pay system in between me making the two separate payments.

Despite my objections, the cashier insisted that the QR payment would not go through and that I should give her my CC to pay the full tab. Unsurprisingly the charge was not reversed and despite multiple phone calls with the restaurant trying to navigate through the dispute process with my bank, I haven't been able to get in contact with anyone able to correct the restaurant's error.

Lesson learned, I guess. For what it's worth, food was 4/5.",5 star rating
